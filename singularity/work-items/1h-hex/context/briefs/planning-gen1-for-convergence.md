## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a Hex action to the Standard keypad and connect it to App's existing display state. For eligible
nonnegative whole-number values, replace the displayed decimal value with uppercase base-16 digits;
the required example is `15` → `F`. Keep the change within the existing React state and keypad
patterns. Prove the interaction through the App functional tests; acceptance is functional and has
no screenshot-based visual criterion. (1H-HEX:AC-001, 1H-HEX:AC-002, 1H-HEX:REQ-001,
1H-HEX:REQ-002)

## Test strategy

The App-level regression verifies the visible conversion result and confirms this is a functional,
not screenshot-based, acceptance. Tests must not assert behavior for excluded negative or
fractional inputs because the approved clauses do not define those outcomes. Paths below are exact
repository-relative targets; final changes remain subject to reconciliation.

| Clause | Expected paths | Planned tests | Fulfillment | Observable result | Steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [1H-HEX:AC-001] | `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | With `15` as the current eligible value, activating Hex replaces the existing display value with `F`. | `implementation` |
| [1H-HEX:AC-002] | `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Verify the functional display result; no screenshot or screenshot-derived layout assertion is required. | `implementation` |
| [1H-HEX:REQ-001] | `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Activating Hex converts the current eligible decimal value to base-16 digits and replaces that value in the existing display. | `implementation` |
| [1H-HEX:REQ-002] | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Conversion is scoped to nonnegative whole-number values; behavior for negative and fractional values remains unspecified. | `implementation` |

## Risks and rollback

The existing calculator keeps expression and result state separately; implementation must use the
current displayed value without changing ordinary digit entry or expression evaluation. The
approved scope does not define negative or fractional conversion outcomes, so do not introduce
additional promises for those cases. Acceptance is functional, with no screenshot reference.
Detect regressions with the App interaction test and existing calculator tests. If the feature
causes regressions, remove the Hex handler/control and its tests while preserving unrelated
calculator behavior; no data migration or persisted-state change is planned.
