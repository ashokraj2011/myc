# Active Story phase contract: Implementation

- Work ID: `1h-hex`
- Requested outcome: hex — implement hex operator in calc (full request: Pinned Story source below)
- Work type: `spec-driven-standard`
- Phase: `implementation`
- Generation to author: 1
- Changes allowed: May edit this phase's artifacts only. Open a code generation before application edits.

- Default publication producer: `governed-agent`
- Allowed publication producers: `governed-agent`, `human`
- Required publication channel: `copilot-host`

# 1h-hex — Implementation Summary

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the implemented outcome, consequential decisions, changed surfaces, validation result,
remaining limitations, and rollout considerations for downstream agents. Keep it evidence-based;
the detailed changed-components and test sections are preserved separately.
-->

## Implemented outcome

TODO: Summarize the implemented behavior.

## Changed components and decisions

TODO: Cite exact changed product-source paths and the qualified `@clause:1h-hex:REQ-001`-style comments that bind applicable planned clauses to implementation. Explain configuration, migrations, deviations, and reviewed test-only or non-code dispositions. A tag alone is not proof of behavior.

## Tests and operational notes

TODO: List executable tests tagged with qualified `@ac:1h-hex:AC-001` IDs, exact commands and observed results, limitations, flags, and rollout notes. Test tags belong in test files; source-bound clause tags belong in product source.

- Authority: this is the requested outcome. Later evidence may refine missing detail but may not silently contradict or replace it.
- Conflict recovery: confirm the intent change with the human. After scope approval, any active phase in any workflow can use `singularity-flow story intent-amendment propose --file <FILE> --reason "<REASON>"`; no convergence finding or revision loop is required. Recompose after authorized approval and acknowledgement. Before scope approval, record the human change in clarification and revise/review the scope draft normally; never rewrite this pinned source.

# Human clarification checkpoint

The `implementation` phase uses clarification mode `when-needed`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: approved deviations, implementation blockers.

- Ask only when a material ambiguity remains after reading the governed evidence.
- If none remains, state that the clarification checkpoint found no material ambiguity and continue.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 3 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Formulating evidence-grounded questions is permitted even while artifact authoring awaits clarification. Never ask the human to supply the questions or generic clarification answers. A menu promise to provide answers is not an answer.
- Do not re-ask established facts or infer answers from generic knowledge. Label hypotheses/design proposals; they become acceptance or specification decisions only with human confirmation.
- Missing record does not mean unanswered. Reuse actual human replies only for the same Story, phase, generation and reviewed context. A failed tool/record write requires recording repair, not repeated questions; preserve the replies and staging file on failure. Changed bindings require review, never automatic answer adoption.
- For intent conflicts, confirm the human change and follow Conflict recovery in the Pinned Story source; never silently overwrite intent.
- Explain each question’s impact; offer an evidence-supported default. Accept explicit “unknown” or non-blocking deferral. Record confirmed decisions in the artifact and deferred items in Open questions with impact and owner.
- Use a file-edit tool to stage only {"responses":[...]} at the issued responseStagingPath (standalone discovery: `git rev-parse --git-path singularity-flow/clarification-responses/implementation-gen<N>.json`). Run the returned recordAction or standalone `singularity-flow clarification record implementation --response-file <that-path>`, without shell chains, then remove staging with a file-edit tool only after success. Never write response input to the CLI-owned `singularity/work-items/**/context/clarifications-*.json` durable path.
- Material unresolved decisions block specification publication; recommendations/placeholders cannot hide them.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication; never assume answers.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Developer agent

Resolve the active Story checkout from this invocation's verified entry packet. The canonical skill owns pause/binding; do not preflight it again. Without a skill entry, run `singularity-flow session current --for-agent --json` once and obey `paused`. Require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. If no Story is attached, use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; stop if neither resolves. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Use CLI-returned `workItemRoot` and artifact or packet paths for governed Story reads and writes; keep them within the bound `workId`.

Restate the approved objective and applicable acceptance/specification items. Inspect governed repository evidence before changing code. Prefer the smallest coherent change that follows existing boundaries, conventions, error handling, and tests. Do not expand scope or silently resolve ambiguity. Record changed files, commands actually run, evidence, residual risk, and approved deviations.

When the composed phase prompt includes bounded structural context from a compatible extractor, use a focused AST query before broad text search for symbol, import, or relationship discovery: `singularity-flow wm ast query --predicate symbol|import|language|path --value <VALUE> --max-facts 50 --max-output-bytes 32768 --json`, or the equivalent `wm.ast.query` gateway read. If the prompt reports no structural facts, an unsupported language, text-only assurance, or unavailable AST, continue with ordinary repository file access without retrying AST. Follow `nextCursor` only while the question remains unanswered. Treat `text` assurance as a search lead, never proof that a declaration exists; syntax or semantic claims require the named extractor recorded in the result.

Follow the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification checkpoint before authoring; its mode and recording instructions override generic agent guidance. When clarification is allowed, focus on implementation blockers or approved-specification deviations. Do not reopen settled product or architecture choices.

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a Hex action to the calculator that converts the current nonnegative whole-number value from
decimal to base 16 and replaces the value in the existing display. The confirmed example is 15
becoming F. Negative and fractional inputs, hexadecimal input parsing, and hexadecimal arithmetic
are outside this version's scope. Acceptance is functional; no screenshot reference was provided.

## Actors

- **Calculator user:** operates the existing calculator and activates the Hex action. No distinct
  roles or additional permission levels are specified.

## User scenarios

### S1 — Convert the current calculator value to hexadecimal

**Priority:** P1  
**Actor:** Calculator user  
**Context:** The existing calculator display contains a nonnegative whole-number value in decimal.

- **Given** the display contains `15`
  **When** the user activates Hex
  **Then** the existing display is replaced with `F`.

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty or ineligible value:** Conversion is specified only for nonnegative whole numbers.
  Behavior for an empty display, a negative value, or a fractional value is not defined by the
  confirmed scope.
- **Failure or partial result:** The request specifies a direct display conversion and no
  dependency or multi-step operation. No additional failure or partial-result behavior is specified.

## Permissions

No role-based access or permission changes are specified. The action is for the calculator user
described in S1.

## Boundary conditions

- The confirmed input domain is nonnegative whole-number values.
- Negative and fractional values are excluded.
- No numeric maximum or additional formatting rule is specified. The confirmed example is `15`
  displayed as `F`.

## Requirements

> Exact clauses in Active Clause Capsule: 1H-HEX:REQ-001, 1H-HEX:REQ-002.

## Non-functional requirements

No non-functional requirement is specified in the pinned Story or clarification responses.

## Assumptions

- “Hex operator” means converting the current calculator value from decimal to hexadecimal, as
  confirmed for this Story.
- The example `15` → `F` is the required observable display result. No further casing, prefix,
  spacing, or layout behavior is asserted.

## Out of scope

- Parsing hexadecimal input as a calculator value.
- Hexadecimal arithmetic.
- Conversion behavior for negative or fractional values.
- Screenshot-specific visual design or layout requirements.

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a Hex action to the Standard keypad and connect it to App's existing display state. For eligible
nonnegative whole-number values, replace the displayed decimal value with uppercase base-16 digits;
the required example is `15` → `F`. Keep the change within the existing React state and keypad
patterns. Prove the interaction through the App functional tests; acceptance is functional and has
no screenshot-based visual criterion. (1H-HEX:AC-001, 1H-HEX:AC-002, 1H-HEX:REQ-001,
1H-HEX:REQ-002)

## Test strategy

The App-level regression verifies the visible conversion result and confirms this is a functional,
not screenshot-based, acceptance. Tests must not assert behavior for excluded negative or
fractional inputs because the approved clauses do not define those outcomes. Paths below are exact
repository-relative targets; final changes remain subject to reconciliation.

| Clause | Expected paths | Planned tests | Fulfillment | Observable result | Steps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [1H-HEX:AC-001] | `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | With `15` as the current eligible value, activating Hex replaces the existing display value with `F`. | `implementation` |
| [1H-HEX:AC-002] | `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Verify the functional display result; no screenshot or screenshot-derived layout assertion is required. | `implementation` |
| [1H-HEX:REQ-001] | `src/App.jsx`, `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Activating Hex converts the current eligible decimal value to base-16 digits and replaces that value in the existing display. | `implementation` |
| [1H-HEX:REQ-002] | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Conversion is scoped to nonnegative whole-number values; behavior for negative and fractional values remains unspecified. | `implementation` |

## Risks and rollback

The existing calculator keeps expression and result state separately; implementation must use the
current displayed value without changing ordinary digit entry or expression evaluation. The
approved scope does not define negative or fractional conversion outcomes, so do not introduce
additional promises for those cases. Acceptance is functional, with no screenshot reference.
Detect regressions with the App interaction test and existing calculator tests. If the feature
causes regressions, remove the Hex handler/control and its tests while preserving unrelated
calculator behavior; no data migration or persisted-state change is planned.

# Final clarification guard

The pinned clarification mode for `implementation` is `when-needed`; this instruction overrides conflicting generic skill, agent, template, or repository prose.
Ask and record a bounded batch only if material ambiguity remains after governed evidence is read; otherwise continue without a clarification record.
