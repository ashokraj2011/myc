# Specification — fact-01

<!--
Scenarios come first, and general requirements come after them `[SPK:REQ-068]`. That ordering is the
template's opinion: a requirement written before anyone has described the situation it serves tends
to describe the system instead of the need, and nobody notices until verification.

Where the current Story evidence leaves something material unknown, say so with a marker rather
than guessing. Use this syntax:

    [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <one question grounded in the current Story evidence>]

Replace the angle-bracketed placeholder; never copy or ask it as written. The question must be one
non-empty line and must arise from the pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world
model, or a contradiction among them. Markers are extracted the same way clauses are, so a marker
inside fenced or inline code is ignored `[SPK:REQ-063]`. This phase blocks publication while any
marker is unresolved, and a marker is only resolved when a later generation removes it *and* records
the answer `[SPK:REQ-067]` — deleting the text alone is an integrity failure, not an answer.
-->

Keep every section of this template. When one does not fit this change (for example Permissions
for a library or command-line tool with no roles), write `Not applicable: <reason>` under it
rather than deleting it: later steps carry Actors, Failure and empty states, Permissions,
Boundary conditions and the other sections forward, and stop when one is missing.

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the approved intent for downstream agents in a compact, standalone form. Include the
problem, intended outcome, principal actors, most important scenarios, hard constraints, and major
exclusions. Do not introduce claims that are absent from the sections below. Exact requirements and
boundary conditions are preserved separately by the governed projection.
-->

Add an nCr calculation function and expose it through the calculator UI. For positive integer inputs n and r, calculate the number of ways to choose r items from n; return 0 when r > n, and reject non-integer or non-positive inputs. A screenshot must show a representative input and its correct result, such as 5 choose 2 = 10. No new controls, wording, roles, or non-functional constraints are specified.

## Actors

Not applicable: the Story specifies no roles or authorization; the feature is for calculator users.

## User scenarios

Prioritized. Each scenario leads with the situation, then its acceptance cases.

<!-- Before drafting, split the pinned request and recorded answers into observable obligations
for the actual interfaces (UI, API, event/message, batch/job, CLI, library or mixed). Keep the
source -> REQ/AC -> assertion -> verification mapping in the existing sections. Existing ACs count;
do not duplicate clauses or invent controls, endpoints, limits, errors or screenshot requirements.
Self-check whether an implementation could meet this draft yet omit an explicit request. Repair
clear omissions in this editable draft and recheck within the returned repair policy; preserve
published inputs and settled answers. These are authoring instructions, not execution evidence. -->

### S1 — Calculate a combination in the calculator

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator is available and the user wants to count selections of r items from n.

- **Given** the user supplies n = 5 and r = 2 through the calculator UI
  **When** the user requests an nCr calculation
  **Then** the UI displays the result 10.

- **Given** positive integer inputs n and r with r <= n
  **When** the user requests an nCr calculation
  **Then** the callable function returns the number of ways to choose r items from n.

### S2 — Handle input boundaries

**Priority:** P2

- **Given** positive integer inputs with r > n
  **When** the user requests an nCr calculation
  **Then** the function returns 0.

- **Given** either input is not an integer or is not positive
  **When** the user requests an nCr calculation
  **Then** the input is rejected and no nCr result is produced.

- **Given** n or r has not been supplied
  **When** the user requests an nCr calculation
  **Then** no nCr result is produced until both inputs are supplied as positive integers.

## Failure and empty states

What happens the first time, with nothing there yet, and when each step fails. These are where
specifications are usually silent and implementations usually improvise.

- **Empty:** No result is produced until both n and r are supplied as positive integers.
- **Failure:** Non-integer and non-positive inputs are rejected without producing an nCr result; no particular error wording is specified.
- **Partial:** Not applicable: the Story specifies a single calculation and no partial or external operation.

## Scenario coverage

<!-- One row per behavior/acceptance clause; repeat rows for multiple outcomes. Every referenced
S-number must have complete Given/When/Then acceptance cases above. Outcome is success, failure,
boundary, or empty. Rejection/error requirements need distinct failure cases, not only happy-path
prose. Use the pinned request and clarification answers; do not invent error text or new scope. -->

| Clause | Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `FACT-01:REQ-001` | S1 | success |
| `FACT-01:REQ-002` | S1 | success |
| `FACT-01:REQ-003` | S2 | boundary |
| `FACT-01:REQ-004` | S2 | failure |
| `FACT-01:REQ-004` | S2 | empty |
| `FACT-01:AC-001` | S1 | success |

## Permissions

Not applicable: no role-based permissions or restricted actions are specified.

## Boundary conditions

n and r must be positive integers. If r <= n, the function returns the combination count; if r > n, it returns 0. Non-integer and non-positive inputs are rejected. No maximum input size or other numeric limit is specified.

## Requirements

Numbered, testable, one obligation each. Cite the scenario each serves.

- For positive integer n and r where r <= n, the callable nCr function returns the integer count of ways to choose r items from n; for example, nCr(5, 2) returns 10. *(S1)* [FACT-01:REQ-001]
- The calculator UI lets a user supply n and r and request an nCr calculation, then displays the computed result for valid inputs. *(S1)* [FACT-01:REQ-002]
- The function returns 0 for positive integer inputs where r > n. *(S2)* [FACT-01:REQ-003]
- The function rejects inputs where either value is not an integer or is not positive without producing an nCr result; no result is produced until both inputs are supplied. *(S2)* [FACT-01:REQ-004]

Acceptance criteria use the same stable, namespaced form:

- A screenshot shows the calculator UI with a representative nCr input and its correct output, such as n = 5, r = 2, result = 10. [scope:SRI-35efa5d9d09b] *(S1)* [FACT-01:AC-001]

## Verification intent

<!-- One row per declared clause, including non-functional requirements. Methods: test, visual,
inspection, or a comma-separated combination (all required). AC Criterion is its own ID. A
visual/inspection requirement names the AC proving it; a test-only requirement may use -. Choose
from the pinned source, not from available tools. A screenshot is visual proof, not a test exemption.
Planning must inherit these methods and cannot change them without an approved scope amendment. -->

| Clause | Methods | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| `FACT-01:REQ-001` | test | - |
| `FACT-01:REQ-002` | test | - |
| `FACT-01:REQ-003` | test | - |
| `FACT-01:REQ-004` | test | - |
| `FACT-01:AC-001` | visual | `FACT-01:AC-001` |

## Non-functional requirements

Not applicable: the pinned request and clarification specify no non-functional requirements.

Use governed requirement anchors here too (for example `[FACT-01:REQ-003]`); `NFR-001` by
itself is only a display label and is not a stable clause identity.

## Constitution articles

Cite the article IDs this specification is bound by `[SPK:REQ-100]`. The kernel validates that each
cited ID exists at the pinned revision before publication `[SPK:REQ-101]`.

None: this Story pinned no constitution.

## Assumptions

The request's nCr notation means choosing r items from n items. The function and calculator UI are part of the requested feature; exact UI controls and error wording are not specified.

## Out of scope

No additional calculator features, APIs, roles, or constraints beyond the nCr function, UI exposure, positive-integer validation, r > n behavior, and screenshot acceptance are in scope.

## Sources

No supporting documents were offered. This specification relies on the pinned Story source and the repository brief delivered with the phase context.
