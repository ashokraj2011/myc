## Summary from “Agent brief”

The calculator user needs a button that converts the decimal value currently shown in the
calculator display to its binary representation. Supported inputs are positive and negative whole
numbers and decimal values with up to two fractional decimal places. Negative results use a leading
minus sign before the binary magnitude; fractional results show two binary fractional digits and
truncate remaining bits. Acceptance requires both Playwright test cases and screenshot/visual
evidence. This specification does not authorize changes to unrelated calculator behavior.

## Actors

- **Calculator user:** selects the conversion button for the value currently shown.
- **Test runner:** exercises the conversion flow with Playwright and captures screenshot/visual
  evidence for acceptance.

## User scenarios

Prioritized. Each scenario leads with the situation, then its acceptance cases.

                                                                                               
                                                                                              
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                  
                                                                                               
                                                                                              
                                                                                                   

### S1 — Convert a whole-number value

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator displays a positive or negative whole-number value.

- **Given** a positive or negative whole-number value is visible in the calculator display
  **When** the user selects the conversion button
  **Then** the calculator displays that value in binary, using a leading minus sign followed by
  the binary magnitude for negative values.

### S2 — Convert a decimal value with fractional digits

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator displays a positive or negative decimal value with no more than two
fractional decimal places.

- **Given** a positive or negative decimal value with up to two fractional decimal places is visible
  in the calculator display
  **When** the user selects the conversion button
  **Then** the calculator displays its binary representation, using a leading minus sign followed by
  its binary magnitude for negative values and exactly two binary fractional digits, truncating any
  remaining fractional bits.

### S3 — Verify the conversion

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Test runner
**Context:** The conversion behavior is available.

- **Given** the conversion button and supported whole-number and decimal values in the calculator
  display
  **When** a Playwright test exercises the conversions and captures screenshot evidence
  **Then** the test and screenshot/visual evidence show the conversion control and binary results.

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty:** No stored records are part of this feature. Behavior when the display has no value is
  not specified by the Story.
- **Failure:** No dependency failure behavior or error wording is specified.
- **Partial:** No multi-step or persistence behavior is specified; partial completion is not
  applicable to the stated conversion flow.

## Permissions

No feature-specific permission or role restriction is stated. The calculator user may invoke the
conversion button under the application's existing access rules.

## Boundary conditions

Supported values are positive and negative whole numbers and positive and negative decimal values
with up to two fractional decimal places. For negative values, display a leading minus sign followed
by the binary magnitude. For fractional binary results, display exactly two binary fractional
digits and truncate remaining fractional bits. Decimal values with more than two fractional decimal
places are outside the confirmed input scope.

## Requirements

Numbered, testable obligations cite the scenario each serves.

- The calculator provides a button that converts the decimal value currently shown in its display
  and displays that value's binary representation. *(S1, S2)* [BIN-OPR2:REQ-001]
- The conversion supports positive and negative whole numbers and decimal inputs with up to two
  fractional decimal places. Negative values display a leading minus sign followed by the binary
  magnitude; fractional results display exactly two binary fractional digits, truncating remaining
  bits. *(S1, S2)* [BIN-OPR2:REQ-002]

Acceptance criteria use the same stable, namespaced form:

- A Playwright test exercises the conversion flow, and screenshot/visual evidence shows the
  conversion control and binary results for the supported whole-number and decimal inputs. This
  covers the Story's “Screenshot playright testcases” acceptance statement. *(S3)*
  [BIN-OPR2:AC-001] [scope:SRI-bfb83cd3d1fd]

## Non-functional requirements

No non-functional requirement is stated in the pinned Story or recorded clarifications.

## Assumptions

- “Calc” means the existing calculator interface; the user confirmed the conversion is initiated by
  a button.
- “Value in display” means the decimal value currently shown when the user activates that button.

## Out of scope

No changes to unrelated calculator operations or additional interfaces are requested. Application
implementation is outside this specification-authoring phase.
