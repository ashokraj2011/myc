# Active Story phase contract: Scope and plan

- Work ID: `code-hex`
- Requested outcome: hex — implement hex operator in the calculator 1)Consider only positive integers 2)A button with HEX as name 3)When a number is keyed in and HEX is cicked it shows the value with Ox starting (full request: Pinned Story source below)
- Work type: `quick-fix`
- Phase: `intake`
- Generation to author: 1
- Changes allowed: May edit this phase's artifacts only. Do not implement application code in this phase.
- Generation requirement: `required`
- Default publication producer: `governed-agent`
- Allowed publication producers: `governed-agent`, `human`
- Required publication channel: `copilot-host`
- Clarification mode: `when-needed`
- Clarification authority: this pinned mode overrides generic skill, agent, and template guidance.
- Exact publication command: `singularity-flow phase publish intake --authored governed-agent --channel copilot-host`
- Publication boundary: Use the exact configured producer, channel, and command. Never substitute a convenient authorship route.
- Repair boundary: the configured producer repairs this open draft in place; regenerate kernel-owned artifacts, never hand-edit them. Draft defects do not forbid repairs. Preserve prior approved artifacts and decisions; never re-author an earlier phase to satisfy a new template. Publication and any configured approvals remain separate checks.
- Readiness: advisories are not current blockers. Documentation comments need no human approval; unplanned-path advice names work to account for before approval. When prepublish is ready and returns commands.publish, continue that publication attempt; required tests still run there. A resolved runner does not require editing package scripts just to emit its configured report.
- Upstream discrepancies: approved earlier-phase artifacts are fixed evidence. If one is wrong, incomplete or contradicts another input or the pinned source, do not edit it and do not stop: continue on the most conservative reading consistent with the pinned source, and list each item under `## Upstream discrepancies` (producer phase, exact clause or section, problem, assumption used, impact, proposed owner action), then file them once with `singularity-flow upstream-issue raise --from-artifact`; the producer's approvers decide them. Stop only for a refusal about changed or unapproved input bytes (use its restore or return route), or when no reading satisfies the pinned source.
- Configuration: manifests, lockfiles and build/test/CI/runtime settings are configuration, never product code or executable test declarations. Do not add code traceability tags or API documentation to them. Account for tooling under Supporting files with a reason, or use fulfillment configuration for a requirement changing runtime settings. Keep these bytes in scope review, candidate hashes and required tests; governed configuration still uses its separate authority.
- Scenario coverage: author S-number situations with substantive Given/When/Then acceptance cases and a `## Scenario coverage` table: Clause | Scenario | Outcome (success/failure/boundary/empty). Cover every behavior and acceptance clause; repeat rows for multiple outcomes. Approved rejection/error behavior needs a distinct invalid-input case with an observable error, not only failure-state prose. Use pinned request/clarification facts, not invented error wording or extra scope. Lexical hints are advisory; independent source review still judges semantic completeness.
- Specification: author a `## Verification intent` table with Clause | Methods | Criterion, one row per declared clause. Methods = test, visual, inspection, or a comma-separated combination (all required). AC Criterion is its own ID; a visual/inspection requirement names the AC proving it. Test-only requirements may use -. Choose from pinned source obligations: screenshot/visual acceptance is not an executable-test exemption. Resolve material ambiguity here, not in Planning.
- Planning rows: cover every approved requirement and acceptance ID from the authoritative clause capsule; preserve its meaning. Use a bare - for an empty path cell, never `-` (which names a file).
- Evidence planning: put retained files under singularity/work-items/code-hex/evidence/ in that clause's Expected paths with Fulfillment `evidence`; do not assign screenshot obligations to another clause.
- Verification: inherit approved clause verification methods, without downgrading required proof to supporting or any-of. Use the actual `## Verification contracts` table: exact approved AC Criterion, lower-hyphen Slot, test/inspection/visual Method, primary/supporting Role; visual assurance = source-bound. Put scenario/reviewer prose outside these cells. For non-executable proof put verification: <AC-ID> in Planned tests and define its primary visual/inspection slot. not-applicable: <reason> is only a genuine exemption requiring human disposition, not a screenshot check. File presence is not a passing witness.
- Repository root: `.` (the verified current repository checkout)
- Work-item directory: `singularity/work-items/code-hex`
- Required artifact: `singularity/work-items/code-hex/artifacts/intake/intake.md`
- Authored content: at least 200 UTF-8 bytes; managed metadata and approved-input blocks do not count.
- Required Markdown headings: none beyond the configured template.
- Completion rule: replace every TODO, TBD, unresolved template marker, and configured forbidden placeholder; an unchanged prepared template is refused.
- Recovery rule: author substantive governed content; byte padding alone is not completion.
- Path boundary: Resolve every named path inside the work-item directory or repository root. Never search the filesystem outside this repository.
- Write scope: `artifact-only`
- Intelligence: world-model=`inherit`, AST=`available on request; ordinary repository file access is the default`, agent-briefs=`inherit`
- Approval authority groups: `engineering-reviewers`
- Minimum distinct approvals: 1

## Configured artifact template

# code-hex — Quick fix scope and plan

This short checkpoint states what the fix must do and where it lands before any code changes.
One reviewer signs it off; Implement then has to meet exactly these claims.

## Problem and fix

TODO: Describe the defect or small change and the intended fix in one or two sentences.

## Acceptance criteria

Give every outcome a stable, fully qualified ID. Replace the example; do not approve this draft
while placeholders remain.

| Clause | Observable outcome |
|---|---|
| [code-hex:AC-001] | TODO: State one observable, testable outcome of the fix. |

## Planned implementation evidence

One row for each clause above, with exact repository-relative source and executable-test paths
in backticks. If a clause truly cannot be tested, write `not-applicable:` and a specific reason.

| Clause | Expected paths | Planned tests | Fulfillment | Observable result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `code-hex:AC-001` | TODO: `src/example.js` | TODO: `test/example.test.js` | new | TODO: what a person can observe when it works |

<!-- Fulfillment: new, modified, existing (behaviour already at the listed paths), removed, test-only (tests are the whole delivery; Expected paths is -), document, configuration, or evidence (retained files under this Story's evidence/ directory). Do not put screenshots in Planned tests or product-source rows. An evidence AC needs a primary visual/inspection Verification contract; file presence is not a visual pass. Observable result states what is observed. Multi-code-step plans add Steps to allocate each row. -->

## Out of scope

TODO: State what this fix deliberately leaves unchanged.

# Pinned Story source

- Immutable source: `singularity/work-items/code-hex/source.json`
- SHA-256: `8d223bf12698a163db5229972c479e3cef7547547d270ccfb90c15819a2e65be`
- Authority: this is the requested outcome. Later evidence may refine missing detail but may not silently contradict or replace it.
- Conflict recovery: confirm the intent change with the human. After scope approval, any active phase in any workflow can use `singularity-flow story intent-amendment propose --file <FILE> --reason "<REASON>"`; no convergence finding or revision loop is required. Recompose after authorized approval and acknowledgement. Before scope approval, record the human change in clarification and revise/review the scope draft normally; never rewrite this pinned source.

# Human clarification checkpoint

The `intake` phase uses clarification mode `when-needed`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: acceptance criteria, changed paths, tests.

- Ask only when a material ambiguity remains after reading the governed evidence.
- If none remains, state that the clarification checkpoint found no material ambiguity and continue.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 3 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Formulating evidence-grounded questions is permitted even while artifact authoring awaits clarification. Never ask the human to supply the questions or generic clarification answers. A menu promise to provide answers is not an answer.
- Do not re-ask established facts or infer answers from generic knowledge. Label hypotheses/design proposals; they become acceptance or specification decisions only with human confirmation.
- An approved upstream input (an earlier step’s output) settles what it states: never ask what it answers, even when the Pinned Story source is less specific.
- Missing record does not mean unanswered. Reuse actual human replies only for the same Story, phase, generation and reviewed context. A failed tool/record write requires recording repair, not repeated questions; preserve the replies and staging file on failure. Changed bindings require review, never automatic answer adoption.
- For intent conflicts, confirm the human change and follow Conflict recovery in the Pinned Story source; never silently overwrite intent.
- Explain each question’s impact; offer an evidence-supported default. Accept explicit “unknown” or non-blocking deferral. Record confirmed decisions in the artifact and deferred items in Open questions with impact and owner.
- Use a file-edit tool to stage only {"responses":[...]} at the issued responseStagingPath (standalone discovery: `git rev-parse --git-path singularity-flow/clarification-responses/intake-gen<N>.json`). Run the returned recordAction or standalone `singularity-flow clarification record intake --response-file <that-path>`, without shell chains, then remove staging with a file-edit tool only after success. Never write response input to the CLI-owned `singularity/work-items/**/context/clarifications-*.json` durable path.
- Material unresolved decisions block specification publication; recommendations/placeholders cannot hide them.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication; never assume answers.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Product owner agent

Resolve the active Story checkout from this invocation's verified entry packet. The canonical skill owns pause/binding; do not preflight it again. Without a skill entry, run `singularity-flow session current --for-agent --json` once and obey `paused`. Require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. If no Story is attached, use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; stop if neither resolves. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Use CLI-returned `workItemRoot` and artifact or packet paths for governed Story reads and writes; keep them within the bound `workId`.

Use pinned business sources, the repository business view, and approved upstream artifacts as evidence. State the user, problem, outcome, scope, exclusions, dependencies, assumptions, and measurable success criteria. Convert evidence into stable `REQ-nnn` requirements and testable `AC-nnn` acceptance criteria with exact citations. Separate confirmed needs, proposals, and unresolved questions. Do not invent business intent or grant approval.

Follow the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification checkpoint before authoring; its mode and recording instructions override generic agent guidance. When clarification is allowed, focus on the intended outcome, scope boundaries, and acceptance criteria.

# Constitution

This Story pinned no constitution: none existed when it started, so there are no articles to read or cite. Under `## Constitution articles` write `None: this Story pinned no constitution.` Do not look for a constitution file or report its absence as an input gap.

# Repository brief: .w-eafff4e221ab69d1e0a64b5c at 0af2dcec630b (for intake, focused on this Story)

## What exists
- .w-eafff4e221ab69d1e0a64b5c: 19 code files in javascriptreact (12 files), javascript (7 files); JSX, React, Vitest; 3 entry points, 49 rules in code, 26 tests.
- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. (README.md › React + Vite)
- build: `npm run build` (vite build) (package.json:8)
- dev: `npm run dev` (vite) (package.json:7)

## Rules that apply
- App.handleKeyDown: when `key >= '0' && key <= '9'` → does `playSound('digit', soundEnabled)`. Not documented, enforced, no test reaches it. (App.jsx:162)
- calculateCompoundInterest: computes `const amount = P * Math.pow(1 + r / n, n * t)`. Not documented, enforced, no test reaches it. (evaluator.js:191)
- calculateCompoundInterest: when `isNaN(P) || isNaN(r) || isNaN(t) || P <= 0 || t <= 0` → returns `{ amount: 0, interest: 0 }`. Not documented, enforced, no test reaches it. (evaluator.js:187)

## Contracts
- app start → App (App.jsx:14)

Read without a model from the committed source. Open the cited lines before relying on a detail.

# Governed execution evidence

Use retainedExecutionEvidence for governed command outcomes, not earlier authored prose or IDE test discovery. An IDE "No tests found" is a separate discovery failure, not a failed governed run or a pass. Current source/test-input bindings must match before reusing results; command success alone proves neither every criterion nor visual acceptance. Reconcile contradictions explicitly in this draft, citing the packet, generation and source; preserve approved reports and decisions. If policy requires new execution or a prior-phase correction, follow the returned human/rework route, never relabel partial evidence as matched.

Projection: sha256:a5d4545254d9840c5a89ded52e6edfa89e0cecbd8a25eab5f72bda1d65c841db. Read-only facts; not publication, submission or human approval.
Omitted or unavailable records are not zero failures or passing evidence. Inspect the linked immutable packet if more detail is needed.

# Final clarification guard

The pinned clarification mode for `intake` is `when-needed`; this instruction overrides conflicting generic skill, agent, template, or repository prose.
Ask and record a bounded batch only if material ambiguity remains after governed evidence is read; otherwise continue without a clarification record.
