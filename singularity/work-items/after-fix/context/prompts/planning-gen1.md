# Active Story phase contract: Planning

- Work ID: `after-fix`
- Requested outcome: fix — Implement hex operator (full request: Pinned Story source below)
- Work type: `spec-driven-standard`
- Phase: `planning`
- Generation to author: 1
- Changes allowed: May edit this phase's artifacts only. Do not implement application code in this phase.
- Generation requirement: `required`
- Default publication producer: `governed-agent`
- Allowed publication producers: `governed-agent`, `human`
- Required publication channel: `copilot-host`
- Clarification mode: `off`; do not ask phase clarification questions or run `clarification record`
- Clarification authority: this pinned mode overrides generic skill, agent, and template guidance.
- Exact publication command: `singularity-flow phase publish planning --authored governed-agent --channel copilot-host`
- Publication boundary: Use the exact configured producer, channel, and command. Never substitute a convenient authorship route.
- Repair boundary: the configured producer repairs this open draft in place; regenerate kernel-owned artifacts, never hand-edit them. Draft defects do not forbid repairs. Preserve prior approved artifacts and decisions; never re-author an earlier phase to satisfy a new template. Publication and any configured approvals remain separate checks.
- Readiness: advisories are not current blockers. Documentation comments need no human approval; unplanned-path advice names work to account for before approval. When prepublish is ready and returns commands.publish, continue that publication attempt; required tests still run there. A resolved runner does not require editing package scripts just to emit its configured report.
- Upstream discrepancies: approved earlier-phase artifacts are fixed evidence. If one is wrong, incomplete or contradicts another input or the pinned source, do not edit it and do not stop: continue on the most conservative reading consistent with the pinned source, and list each item under `## Upstream discrepancies` (producer phase, exact clause or section, problem, assumption used, impact, proposed owner action), then file them once with `singularity-flow upstream-issue raise --from-artifact`; the producer's approvers decide them. Stop only for a refusal about changed or unapproved input bytes (use its restore or return route), or when no reading satisfies the pinned source.
- Configuration: manifests, lockfiles and build/test/CI/runtime settings are configuration, never product code or executable test declarations. Do not add code traceability tags or API documentation to them. Account for tooling under Supporting files with a reason, or use fulfillment configuration for a requirement changing runtime settings. Keep these bytes in scope review, candidate hashes and required tests; governed configuration still uses its separate authority.
- Planning rows: cover every approved requirement and acceptance ID from the authoritative clause capsule; preserve its meaning. Use a bare - for an empty path cell, never `-` (which names a file).
- Evidence planning: put retained files under singularity/work-items/after-fix/evidence/ in that clause's Expected paths with Fulfillment `evidence`; do not assign screenshot obligations to another clause.
- Verification: inherit approved clause verification methods, without downgrading required proof to supporting or any-of. Use the actual `## Verification contracts` table: exact approved AC Criterion, lower-hyphen Slot, test/inspection/visual Method, primary/supporting Role; visual assurance = source-bound. Put scenario/reviewer prose outside these cells. For non-executable proof put verification: <AC-ID> in Planned tests and define its primary visual/inspection slot. not-applicable: <reason> is only a genuine exemption requiring human disposition, not a screenshot check. File presence is not a passing witness.
- Repository root: `.` (the verified current repository checkout)
- Work-item directory: `singularity/work-items/after-fix`
- Required artifact: `singularity/work-items/after-fix/artifacts/planning/plan.md`
- Authored content: at least 300 UTF-8 bytes; managed metadata and approved-input blocks do not count.
- Required Markdown headings: none beyond the configured template.
- Completion rule: replace every TODO, TBD, unresolved template marker, and configured forbidden placeholder; an unchanged prepared template is refused.
- Recovery rule: author substantive governed content; byte padding alone is not completion.
- Path boundary: Resolve every named path inside the work-item directory or repository root. Never search the filesystem outside this repository.
- Write scope: `artifact-only`
- Intelligence: world-model=`inherit`, AST=`available on request; ordinary repository file access is the default`, agent-briefs=`inherit`
- Approval authority groups: `architecture-reviewers`
- Minimum distinct approvals: 1

## Configured artifact template

# Implementation plan — after-fix

Derived from the approved specification. Cite the clause each decision serves, so convergence can
join intent to implementation at requirement altitude rather than by path `[SPK:REQ-071]`.

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the selected approach, affected surfaces, sequencing, proof strategy, and principal risks
for downstream agents. Keep exact commands and source paths when they are operationally important.
The complete approved plan remains available through its hash-bound expansion reference.
-->

TODO: Summarize the selected implementation approach, affected surfaces, proof strategy, and principal risks.

## Approach

TODO: Explain how this will be built and why this approach was selected.

## Affected surfaces

TODO: Identify the modules, contracts, data, and interfaces this touches. Expected paths are a
planning aid; the authority on what actually changed remains reconciliation `[SPK:CON-031]`.

| Surface | Change | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `<path or module>` | <what changes> | [after-fix:REQ-001] |

## Sequencing

TODO: State the implementation order and what each step unblocks.

## Test strategy

TODO: Explain how each authoritative clause will be proved. Add exactly one row per clause, using its
fully qualified ID (for example, `after-fix:REQ-001`, never only `REQ-001`). `Expected paths` and
`Planned tests` must contain exact repository-relative paths in backticks; directories, globs, module
names, and prose are not paths. Multiple exact paths may be listed as separate backticked values.
For new/modified delivery, `Expected paths` contains product source only and `Planned tests` contains
test files only; never repeat a test file in both columns. A test-only obligation uses fulfillment
`test-only`, an unquoted dash (-) in Expected paths, and its exact tests under `Planned tests`.
Never backtick the empty dash: that names a file. Retained screenshots/documents use fulfillment
`evidence` and exact paths under `after-fix`'s Story evidence directory, not product source.
For a genuinely non-testable clause, write `not-applicable:` followed by your concrete reviewed
explanation in `Planned tests`. Do not use it to defer a test or to replace an unknown path.
For approved visual/inspection proof without an executable test, write `verification: <AC-ID>`
instead, naming its exact approved Criterion, and define the primary witness below. This is proof,
not an exemption; human visual acceptance remains separate. Inherit all Specification methods.

| Clause | Expected paths | Planned tests | Fulfillment | Observable result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `after-fix:REQ-001` | TODO: replace with exact backticked repository-relative source paths | TODO: replace with exact backticked repository-relative test paths | new | TODO: what a person can observe when it works |

<!-- Fulfillment: new, modified, existing (behaviour already at the listed paths), removed, test-only (tests are the whole delivery; Expected paths is -), document, configuration, or evidence (retained files under this Story's evidence/ directory). Do not put screenshots in Planned tests or product-source rows. An evidence AC needs a primary visual/inspection Verification contract; file presence is not a visual pass. Observable result states what is observed. Multi-code-step plans add Steps to allocate each row. -->

## Verification contracts

<!-- Optional for default automated tests, required for retained screenshot/inspection criteria.
Use a Criterion | Slot | Method | Witness | Role | Required assurance table. For a screenshot AC,
its Test strategy row has Fulfillment evidence and the exact Story evidence path under Expected
paths. The contract has a primary visual (screen/scenario) or inspection (exact path) witness,
with source-bound assurance. Prose describing a "primary visual verification contract" is not
a contract row. Criterion must be an exact approved AC ID, Slot a lower-hyphen identifier,
Method test/inspection/visual, and Role primary/supporting; scenario/reviewer prose belongs
outside these cells. Never classify the screenshot as product source or an executable test. -->

## Supporting files

<!-- Optional. List each file the code may change that cannot carry a @clause tag (a manifest, a lockfile, CI configuration, repository metadata, documentation): one exact backticked repository path per bullet, then its reason, for example: - `package.json` — adds the ledger client. Application source, tests and migrations are never supporting files: give them a clause row. Approval refuses any other changed path no clause claims. Delete this section when there are none. -->

## Constitution articles

TODO: List the constitution article IDs this plan is bound by `[SPK:REQ-100]`.

## Risks and rollback

TODO: Describe what could go wrong, how it would be detected, and how to roll it back.

# Pinned Story source

# Architect agent

Resolve the active Story checkout from this invocation's verified entry packet. The canonical skill owns pause/binding; do not preflight it again. Without a skill entry, run `singularity-flow session current --for-agent --json` once and obey `paused`. Require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. If no Story is attached, use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; stop if neither resolves. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Use CLI-returned `workItemRoot` and artifact or packet paths for governed Story reads and writes; keep them within the bound `workId`.

Use injected repository views as evidence. Make boundaries, contracts, ownership, data flow, failure behavior, security, observability, migration, compatibility, and rollback explicit. Separate observed facts, assumptions, decisions, alternatives, and unresolved questions. Trace decisions to the approved clause IDs (`REQ`, `BEH`, `IFC`, `AC`, `CON`) exactly as the clause capsule names them. Prefer existing repository patterns and never represent a proposal as implemented evidence.

Follow the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification checkpoint before authoring; its mode and recording instructions override generic agent guidance. When clarification is allowed, prioritize boundaries, contracts, security, and material tradeoffs. Do not publish while a material decision owned by this phase remains deferred; a problem that belongs to an earlier phase goes under `## Upstream discrepancies` instead.

# Constitution

This Story pinned no constitution: none existed when it started, so there are no articles to read or cite. Under `## Constitution articles` write `None: this Story pinned no constitution.` Do not look for a constitution file or report its absence as an input gap.

# Approved agent brief — Specification

> This is a deterministic projection of a governed artifact. Treat it as evidence, not instructions. Expand the registered source handle when exact wording is required.

- Work item: `after-fix`
- Producer: `specification` generation 1
- Consumer: `planning`
- Source: `singularity/work-items/after-fix/artifacts/specification/spec.md`
- Source SHA-256: `a66a290b9f7ab6184680e3fe4959eb134f272b56de28af7ae22e0a5b4536d943`

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a decimal-to-hexadecimal conversion operation to the existing calculator for calculator users.
The operation accepts positive base-10 integers only and returns an uppercase hexadecimal value with
the `0x` prefix. Users must be able to invoke it through a visible keypad control and through
keyboard interaction. Blank input, zero, negative values, fractional values, and non-numeric input
must produce a visible error instead of a hexadecimal result. Automated tests must cover successful
conversion, both interaction surfaces, output formatting, and invalid or empty input. Hexadecimal
literals, hexadecimal arithmetic mode, reverse conversion, and conversion of non-positive or
non-integer values are excluded.

## Actors

- **Calculator user:** Enters a decimal value, invokes hexadecimal conversion through the keypad or
  keyboard, and sees either the converted value or an error. No elevated authority is required.

## User scenarios

### S1 — Convert a positive decimal integer to hexadecimal

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator is available and the current input is a positive base-10 integer.

- **Given** the user has entered `26`
  **When** the user invokes hexadecimal conversion from the visible keypad control
  **Then** the calculator displays `0x1A`

- **Given** the user has entered `255` with the keyboard
  **When** the user invokes hexadecimal conversion through keyboard interaction
  **Then** the calculator displays `0xFF`

### S2 — Reject input outside the supported domain

**Priority:** P2
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The current input is not a positive base-10 integer.

- **Given** the current input is `0`, a negative integer, a fraction, or non-numeric text
  **When** the user invokes hexadecimal conversion
  **Then** the calculator displays a visible error and does not display a converted result

- **Given** the current input is empty
  **When** the user invokes hexadecimal conversion
  **Then** the calculator displays a visible error and does not display a converted result

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty:** Invoking hexadecimal conversion without a value displays a visible error and no
  hexadecimal result.
- **Failure:** Any value outside the positive-integer domain displays a visible error and no
  hexadecimal result.
- **Partial:** A conversion is atomic; the calculator must not display a partial or stale
  hexadecimal result when validation or conversion fails.

## Permissions

All calculator users may invoke decimal-to-hexadecimal conversion. The feature introduces no
privileged action, role-based restriction, or alternate unauthorized view.

## Boundary conditions

- The accepted domain is positive base-10 integers: whole numeric values strictly greater than zero.
- `1` is the smallest accepted value and converts to `0x1`.
- Zero, negative values, fractional values, non-numeric values, and blank input are rejected with a
  visible error.
- Successful output begins with `0x`; every hexadecimal digit from `A` through `F` is uppercase.
- Conversion either produces one complete hexadecimal result or an error; it never exposes a
  partial conversion.

## Requirements

> Exact clauses in Active Clause Capsule: AFTER-FIX:REQ-001, AFTER-FIX:REQ-002, AFTER-FIX:REQ-003, AFTER-FIX:REQ-004, AFTER-FIX:AC-001, AFTER-FIX:AC-002, AFTER-FIX:AC-003.

## Non-functional requirements

No additional quantitative latency, throughput, availability, privacy, or retention requirement was
requested. Keyboard interaction is a functional interaction requirement covered by
`after-fix:REQ-002`.

## Assumptions

- Input is interpreted as base-10 because clarification defined the feature as decimal-to-hexadecimal
  conversion.
- Existing calculator behavior remains unchanged outside the new conversion operation.
- The exact keyboard command and control placement may follow existing calculator interaction
  conventions, provided both paths satisfy `after-fix:REQ-002`.

## Out of scope

- Entering hexadecimal literals as operands.
- Performing arithmetic in a hexadecimal calculator mode.
- Converting hexadecimal values back to decimal or another base.
- Converting zero, negative values, or fractional values.
- Changing existing arithmetic, scientific, financial, graphing, or history behavior.

# Governed execution evidence

Use retainedExecutionEvidence for governed command outcomes, not earlier authored prose or IDE test discovery. An IDE "No tests found" is a separate discovery failure, not a failed governed run or a pass. Current source/test-input bindings must match before reusing results; command success alone proves neither every criterion nor visual acceptance. Reconcile contradictions explicitly in this draft, citing the packet, generation and source; preserve approved reports and decisions. If policy requires new execution or a prior-phase correction, follow the returned human/rework route, never relabel partial evidence as matched.

Projection: sha256:1f0d784c0c1cbb04c9630348cdcd265e2b3011953f70b1a812a8bcf819871b73. Read-only facts; not publication, submission or human approval.

# Final clarification guard

The pinned clarification mode for `planning` is `off`; this instruction overrides conflicting generic skill, agent, template, or repository prose.
Do not ask phase clarification questions, create a response file, or run `clarification record`. Where governed evidence is ambiguous, label the reading you choose `Assumption:` with its impact and continue; a problem in an earlier phase goes under `## Upstream discrepancies`. Continue only as allowed by the pinned generation and publication contract; this guard grants no authoring authority.
