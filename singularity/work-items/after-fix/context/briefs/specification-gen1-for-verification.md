## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a decimal-to-hexadecimal conversion operation to the existing calculator for calculator users.
The operation accepts positive base-10 integers only and returns an uppercase hexadecimal value with
the `0x` prefix. Users must be able to invoke it through a visible keypad control and through
keyboard interaction. Blank input, zero, negative values, fractional values, and non-numeric input
must produce a visible error instead of a hexadecimal result. Automated tests must cover successful
conversion, both interaction surfaces, output formatting, and invalid or empty input. Hexadecimal
literals, hexadecimal arithmetic mode, reverse conversion, and conversion of non-positive or
non-integer values are excluded.

## Actors

- **Calculator user:** Enters a decimal value, invokes hexadecimal conversion through the keypad or
  keyboard, and sees either the converted value or an error. No elevated authority is required.

## User scenarios

### S1 — Convert a positive decimal integer to hexadecimal

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator is available and the current input is a positive base-10 integer.

- **Given** the user has entered `26`
  **When** the user invokes hexadecimal conversion from the visible keypad control
  **Then** the calculator displays `0x1A`

- **Given** the user has entered `255` with the keyboard
  **When** the user invokes hexadecimal conversion through keyboard interaction
  **Then** the calculator displays `0xFF`

### S2 — Reject input outside the supported domain

**Priority:** P2
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The current input is not a positive base-10 integer.

- **Given** the current input is `0`, a negative integer, a fraction, or non-numeric text
  **When** the user invokes hexadecimal conversion
  **Then** the calculator displays a visible error and does not display a converted result

- **Given** the current input is empty
  **When** the user invokes hexadecimal conversion
  **Then** the calculator displays a visible error and does not display a converted result

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty:** Invoking hexadecimal conversion without a value displays a visible error and no
  hexadecimal result.
- **Failure:** Any value outside the positive-integer domain displays a visible error and no
  hexadecimal result.
- **Partial:** A conversion is atomic; the calculator must not display a partial or stale
  hexadecimal result when validation or conversion fails.

## Permissions

All calculator users may invoke decimal-to-hexadecimal conversion. The feature introduces no
privileged action, role-based restriction, or alternate unauthorized view.

## Boundary conditions

- The accepted domain is positive base-10 integers: whole numeric values strictly greater than zero.
- `1` is the smallest accepted value and converts to `0x1`.
- Zero, negative values, fractional values, non-numeric values, and blank input are rejected with a
  visible error.
- Successful output begins with `0x`; every hexadecimal digit from `A` through `F` is uppercase.
- Conversion either produces one complete hexadecimal result or an error; it never exposes a
  partial conversion.

## Requirements

- The calculator shall convert a positive base-10 integer to its mathematically equivalent hexadecimal value. *(S1)* [after-fix:REQ-001]
- The calculator shall expose hexadecimal conversion through both a visible keypad control and keyboard interaction. *(S1)* [after-fix:REQ-002]
- The calculator shall format every successful conversion with a `0x` prefix and uppercase hexadecimal digits. *(S1)* [after-fix:REQ-003]
- The calculator shall reject blank input, zero, negative values, fractional values, and non-numeric input with a visible error and no converted result. *(S2)* [after-fix:REQ-004]

- Converting `1`, `26`, and `255` shall produce `0x1`, `0x1A`, and `0xFF`, respectively, with the successful cases exercised through the keypad and keyboard interaction paths. *(S1)* [after-fix:AC-001]
- Attempting conversion with blank input, `0`, a negative integer, a fraction, or non-numeric input shall display an error and shall not display a hexadecimal result. *(S2)* [after-fix:AC-002]
- Automated test cases shall verify successful conversion, both interaction surfaces, uppercase prefixed formatting, and each declared invalid or empty input category. *(S1, S2)* [after-fix:AC-003]

## Non-functional requirements

No additional quantitative latency, throughput, availability, privacy, or retention requirement was
requested. Keyboard interaction is a functional interaction requirement covered by
`after-fix:REQ-002`.

## Assumptions

- Input is interpreted as base-10 because clarification defined the feature as decimal-to-hexadecimal
  conversion.
- Existing calculator behavior remains unchanged outside the new conversion operation.
- The exact keyboard command and control placement may follow existing calculator interaction
  conventions, provided both paths satisfy `after-fix:REQ-002`.

## Out of scope

- Entering hexadecimal literals as operands.
- Performing arithmetic in a hexadecimal calculator mode.
- Converting hexadecimal values back to decimal or another base.
- Converting zero, negative values, or fractional values.
- Changing existing arithmetic, scientific, financial, graphing, or history behavior.
