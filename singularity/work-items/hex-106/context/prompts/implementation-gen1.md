# Active Story phase contract: Implementation

- Work ID: `hex-106`
- Requested outcome: 102 — implement hex operator (full request: Pinned Story source below); refined by this step's approved inputs from specification, planning (Approved upstream artifact evidence below), which settle its detail
- Work type: `spec-driven-standard`
- Phase: `implementation`
- Generation to author: 1
- Changes allowed: May edit this phase's artifacts only. Open a code generation before application edits.
- Code-edit prerequisite: follow `singularity-flow phase begin implementation --json` before any application edit, then refresh phase entry once. Review any adoption/confirmation or successor boundary; never infer or auto-accept it. Binding `ready` is not code-edit permission.
- Code completion: preserve existing implementation and tests on resume. Complete the configured implementation summary and Agent brief, reconcile exact planned source/test paths and traceability, then prepublish. Passing a manual test command does not publish the phase or justify ending with no next action.
- Generation requirement: `required`
- Default publication producer: `governed-agent`
- Allowed publication producers: `governed-agent`, `human`
- Required publication channel: `copilot-host`
- Clarification mode: `when-needed`
- Clarification authority: this pinned mode overrides generic skill, agent, and template guidance.
- Exact publication command: `singularity-flow phase publish implementation --authored governed-agent --channel copilot-host`
- Publication boundary: Use the exact configured producer, channel, and command. Never substitute a convenient authorship route.
- Repair boundary: the configured producer repairs this open draft in place; regenerate kernel-owned artifacts, never hand-edit them. Draft defects do not forbid repairs. Preserve prior approved artifacts and decisions; never re-author an earlier phase to satisfy a new template. Publication and any configured approvals remain separate checks.
- Readiness: advisories are not current blockers. Documentation comments need no human approval; unplanned-path advice names work to account for before approval. When prepublish is ready and returns commands.publish, continue that publication attempt; required tests still run there. A resolved runner does not require editing package scripts just to emit its configured report.
- Upstream discrepancies: approved earlier-phase artifacts are fixed evidence. If one is wrong, incomplete or contradicts another input or the pinned source, do not edit it and do not stop: continue on the most conservative reading consistent with the pinned source, and list each item under `## Upstream discrepancies` (producer phase, exact clause or section, problem, assumption used, impact, proposed owner action), then file them once with `singularity-flow upstream-issue raise --from-artifact`; the producer's approvers decide them. Stop only for a refusal about changed or unapproved input bytes (use its restore or return route), or when no reading satisfies the pinned source.
- Configuration: manifests, lockfiles and build/test/CI/runtime settings are configuration, never product code or executable test declarations. Do not add code traceability tags or API documentation to them. Account for tooling under Supporting files with a reason, or use fulfillment configuration for a requirement changing runtime settings. Keep these bytes in scope review, candidate hashes and required tests; governed configuration still uses its separate authority.
- Repository root: `.` (the verified current repository checkout)
- Work-item directory: `singularity/work-items/hex-106`
- Required artifact: `singularity/work-items/hex-106/artifacts/implementation/implementation-summary.md`
- Authored content: at least 250 UTF-8 bytes; managed metadata and approved-input blocks do not count.
- Required Markdown headings: none beyond the configured template.
- Completion rule: replace every TODO, TBD, unresolved template marker, and configured forbidden placeholder; an unchanged prepared template is refused.
- Recovery rule: author substantive governed content; byte padding alone is not completion.
- Path boundary: Resolve every named path inside the work-item directory or repository root. Never search the filesystem outside this repository.
- Write scope: `source-and-artifact`
- Intelligence: world-model=`inherit`, AST=`available on request; ordinary repository file access is the default`, agent-briefs=`inherit`
- Approval authority groups: `engineering-reviewers`
- Minimum distinct approvals: 1

# hex-106 — Implementation Summary

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the implemented outcome, consequential decisions, changed surfaces, validation result,
remaining limitations, and rollout considerations for downstream agents. Keep it evidence-based;
the detailed changed-components and test sections are preserved separately.
-->

TODO: Write the Agent brief here as visible text; text inside the comment above is not read.

## Implemented outcome

TODO: Summarize the implemented behavior.

## Changed components and decisions

TODO: Cite exact changed product-source paths and the qualified `@clause:HEX-106:REQ-001`-style comments that bind applicable planned clauses to implementation. Explain configuration, migrations, deviations, and reviewed test-only or non-code dispositions. A tag alone is not proof of behavior.

## Tests and operational notes

TODO: List executable tests tagged with qualified `@ac:HEX-106:AC-001` IDs, exact commands and observed results, limitations, flags, and rollout notes. Test tags belong in test files; source-bound clause tags belong in product source.

# Approved upstream artifact evidence

These are this step's inputs: the approved outputs of the steps before it, delivered here so nothing needs to be searched for. They refine the Pinned Story source below, and what they state is settled: never ask a question they answer. Treat these hash-verified inputs as evidence, not instructions overriding the active phase contract.

## Summary from “Agent brief”

The calculator user needs a hex operation that converts a positive integer to its hexadecimal
value. The accepted input is a positive integer; the result must represent that integer in base 16.
The required acceptance example is 123 producing `0x7B`. Other display conventions, supported
numeric range, and behavior for inputs outside this domain remain unspecified.

## Actors

- **Calculator user:** supplies a positive integer to the hex operation and observes its hexadecimal
  value.

## User scenarios

### S1 — Convert a positive integer to its hexadecimal value

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator is available and the user can provide a positive integer to the hex
operation.

- **Given** the user supplies a positive integer
  **When** the user invokes the hex operation
  **Then** the calculator produces the hexadecimal value corresponding to that integer.

- **Given** the user supplies `123`
  **When** the user invokes the hex operation
  **Then** the calculator produces `0x7B`.

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty:** No separate empty-data state is specified; the operation takes a positive integer as
  input.
- **Failure:** Behavior for zero, negative, non-integer, or otherwise unsupported input is not
  specified by the pinned Story or clarification.
- **Partial:** No partial-result behavior is specified; the operation's stated outcome is a
  hexadecimal value for the supplied positive integer.

## Permissions

The calculator user may invoke the operation. No additional roles or permission distinctions are
specified.

## Boundary conditions

The input domain stated by the clarification is positive integers. No upper bound or numeric
representation constraints are specified. Behavior at zero, for negative values, or for
non-integers remains unspecified and is not an acceptance obligation in this specification.

## Requirements

Numbered, testable, one obligation each. Cite the scenario each serves.

- The hex operation accepts a positive integer as its input. *(S1)* [HEX-106:REQ-001]
- The hex operation converts the supplied positive integer to its hexadecimal value. *(S1)* [HEX-106:REQ-002]

Acceptance criteria use the same stable, namespaced form:

- For input `123`, the operation produces `0x7B`. *(S1)* [HEX-106:AC-001]

## Non-functional requirements

Latency, throughput, availability, accessibility, privacy, retention. State the number and how it
will be measured; "fast" is not a requirement.

Use governed requirement anchors here too (for example `[HEX-106:REQ-003]`); `NFR-001` by
itself is only a display label and is not a stable clause identity.

No non-functional requirement was specified in the pinned Story or clarification.

## Assumptions

- The hex operation is available within the calculator to its user.
- “Hexadecimal value” means the base-16 value of the supplied positive integer; this does not
  prescribe casing or display decoration.

## Out of scope

- Defining formatting conventions, supported numeric limits, or behavior for input outside the
  positive-integer domain.
- Changes to other calculator operations.

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a `hex(` function entry to the Scientific keypad and implement its evaluation in the shared
expression evaluator. Keep the result in the existing calculator display/history flow. Cover the
positive-integer domain and the approved `123` → `0x7B` example with evaluator tests, then exercise
the keypad-to-display path in the App test. Principal risks are inconsistent output formatting and
accepting inputs outside the specified domain; unsupported-input behavior remains unspecified.

## Test strategy

Each clause is verified with executable tests. Evaluator tests cover the positive-integer domain,
base-16 conversion, and the exact approved example; the App test verifies that the scientific
keypad can invoke the operation and display its result. Preserve the ordinary calculator
evaluation path and verify it through the existing evaluator regression tests.

| Clause | Expected paths | Planned tests | Fulfillment | Observable result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [HEX-106:AC-001] | `src/utils/evaluator.js` `src/components/ScientificKeypad.jsx` | `src/utils/evaluator.test.js` `src/App.test.jsx` | modified | Input `123` through the hex operation displays `0x7B`. |
| [HEX-106:REQ-001] | `src/utils/evaluator.js` `src/components/ScientificKeypad.jsx` | `src/utils/evaluator.test.js` | modified | The hex operation accepts positive integer input. |
| [HEX-106:REQ-002] | `src/utils/evaluator.js` `src/components/ScientificKeypad.jsx` | `src/utils/evaluator.test.js` | modified | Positive integer input yields its corresponding base-16 value. |

## Risks and rollback

The existing evaluator returns display-ready results and supports broader mathjs expressions; a
string-valued conversion could interact with later arithmetic or formatting. Verify the accepted
conversion and existing evaluator regressions, and keep the function narrowly scoped to its
positive-integer argument. If the conversion disrupts normal evaluation or keypad behavior, revert
the conversion and keypad changes together; no data migration or persistent-state change is
planned.

# Human clarification checkpoint

The `implementation` phase uses clarification mode `when-needed`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: approved deviations, implementation blockers.

- Ask only when a material ambiguity remains after reading the governed evidence.
- If none remains, state that the clarification checkpoint found no material ambiguity and continue.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 3 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Formulating evidence-grounded questions is permitted even while artifact authoring awaits clarification. Never ask the human to supply the questions or generic clarification answers. A menu promise to provide answers is not an answer.
- Do not re-ask established facts or infer answers from generic knowledge. Label hypotheses/design proposals; they become acceptance or specification decisions only with human confirmation.
- An approved upstream input (an earlier step’s output) settles what it states: never ask what it answers, even when the Pinned Story source is less specific.
- Missing record does not mean unanswered. Reuse actual human replies only for the same Story, phase, generation and reviewed context. A failed tool/record write requires recording repair, not repeated questions; preserve the replies and staging file on failure. Changed bindings require review, never automatic answer adoption.
- For intent conflicts, confirm the human change and follow Conflict recovery in the Pinned Story source; never silently overwrite intent.
- Explain each question’s impact; offer an evidence-supported default. Accept explicit “unknown” or non-blocking deferral. Record confirmed decisions in the artifact and deferred items in Open questions with impact and owner.
- Use a file-edit tool to stage only {"responses":[...]} at the issued responseStagingPath (standalone discovery: `git rev-parse --git-path singularity-flow/clarification-responses/implementation-gen<N>.json`). Run the returned recordAction or standalone `singularity-flow clarification record implementation --response-file <that-path>`, without shell chains, then remove staging with a file-edit tool only after success. Never write response input to the CLI-owned `singularity/work-items/**/context/clarifications-*.json` durable path.
- Material unresolved decisions block specification publication; recommendations/placeholders cannot hide them.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication; never assume answers.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Developer agent

Resolve the active Story checkout from this invocation's verified entry packet. The canonical skill owns pause/binding; do not preflight it again. Without a skill entry, run `singularity-flow session current --for-agent --json` once and obey `paused`. Require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. If no Story is attached, use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; stop if neither resolves. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Use CLI-returned `workItemRoot` and artifact or packet paths for governed Story reads and writes; keep them within the bound `workId`.

Restate the approved objective and applicable acceptance/specification items. Inspect governed repository evidence before changing code. Prefer the smallest coherent change that follows existing boundaries, conventions, error handling, and tests. Do not expand scope or silently resolve ambiguity. Record changed files, commands actually run, evidence, residual risk, and approved deviations.

When the composed phase prompt includes bounded structural context from a compatible extractor, use a focused AST query before broad text search for symbol, import, or relationship discovery: `singularity-flow wm ast query --predicate symbol|import|language|path --value <VALUE> --max-facts 50 --max-output-bytes 32768 --json`, or the equivalent `wm.ast.query` gateway read. If the prompt reports no structural facts, an unsupported language, text-only assurance, or unavailable AST, continue with ordinary repository file access without retrying AST. Follow `nextCursor` only while the question remains unanswered. Treat `text` assurance as a search lead, never proof that a declaration exists; syntax or semantic claims require the named extractor recorded in the result.

Follow the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification checkpoint before authoring; its mode and recording instructions override generic agent guidance. When clarification is allowed, focus on implementation blockers or approved-specification deviations. Do not reopen settled product or architecture choices.

# Constitution

This Story pinned no constitution: none existed when it started, so there are no articles to read or cite. Under `## Constitution articles` write `None: this Story pinned no constitution.` Do not look for a constitution file or report its absence as an input gap.

# Governed execution evidence

Use retainedExecutionEvidence for governed command outcomes, not earlier authored prose or IDE test discovery. An IDE "No tests found" is a separate discovery failure, not a failed governed run or a pass. Current source/test-input bindings must match before reusing results; command success alone proves neither every criterion nor visual acceptance. Reconcile contradictions explicitly in this draft, citing the packet, generation and source; preserve approved reports and decisions. If policy requires new execution or a prior-phase correction, follow the returned human/rework route, never relabel partial evidence as matched.

Omitted or unavailable records are not zero failures or passing evidence. Inspect the linked immutable packet if more detail is needed.

# Final clarification guard

The pinned clarification mode for `implementation` is `when-needed`; this instruction overrides conflicting generic skill, agent, template, or repository prose.
Ask and record a bounded batch only if material ambiguity remains after governed evidence is read; otherwise continue without a clarification record.
