## Summary from “Agent brief”

Added a `hex(` operation to the Scientific keypad and evaluator. Positive integer arguments
produce uppercase hexadecimal text with a `0x` prefix, including the approved `123` → `0x7B`
example. The change is limited to the planned evaluator, keypad, and acceptance-test paths; no
configuration or migration changes were needed. Acceptance tests are authored but were not
executed in this turn; the host test tool reported no tests found for the supplied paths, and
the governed runner requires publication-time execution after code delivery is complete.

## Changed components and decisions

`src/components/ScientificKeypad.jsx` adds the `hex` button and carries the qualified
`@clause:HEX-106:REQ-001` marker. `src/utils/evaluator.js` evaluates `hex(...)` with a scoped
function, checks for a positive integer, and creates the prefixed uppercase hexadecimal
string; it carries `@clause:HEX-106:REQ-001`, `@clause:HEX-106:REQ-002`, and
`@clause:HEX-106:AC-001` markers. `src/utils/evaluator.test.js` covers `hex(123)` and another
positive integer; `src/App.test.jsx` covers invoking the keypad operation and displaying the
approved example. Both tests carry `@ac:HEX-106:AC-001`. No configuration, migration, or
deviation was introduced. Behavior outside the specified positive-integer domain remains
unspecified by the approved specification.

## Tests and operational notes

Acceptance tests tagged `@ac:HEX-106:AC-001`:

- `src/utils/evaluator.test.js`: checks `hex(123)` returns `0x7B` with no evaluation error,
  and checks another positive integer conversion.
- `src/App.test.jsx`: selects Scientific mode, enters `hex(123)` using the keypad, and checks
  the displayed result.

No project test command was executed. The host test tool returned “No tests found in the files”
for the two supplied paths; this is not a test pass or a repository test failure. Governed test
execution is blocked until the code-delivery finding is repaired and publication infers the
runner. No rollout or migration step is required. Inputs outside the positive-integer domain
and numeric representation limits are not specified by the approved inputs.
