## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a minimal browser-side conversion flow to the existing calculator application: render a conversion input and action in the main UI, validate the supported domain (positive base-10 whole numbers greater than zero), convert validated decimal text with `BigInt` so values above JavaScript's safe-integer boundary remain exact, and surface exactly `Not Supported` for every invalid value. The change is constrained to the current browser app and is verified with a small UI regression suite that exercises ordinary, large, and unsupported cases and retains screenshot evidence.

## Test strategy

The implementation will prove each authoritative requirement with the app-level regression test file so the primary path and the unsupported domain are checked end-to-end in the browser.

| Clause | Expected paths | Planned tests | Fulfillment | Observable result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `c-hex:REQ-001` | `src/App.jsx`, `src/App.css` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | The browser page accepts a value and performs hexadecimal conversion without introducing a new backend or privileged flow. |
| `c-hex:REQ-002` | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | A supported positive whole number, including `9007199254740993` above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, displays its mathematically equivalent hexadecimal value (`20000000000001`) without an application-defined maximum. |
| `c-hex:REQ-003` | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Every valid result uses uppercase hexadecimal characters and omits the `0x` prefix. |
| `c-hex:REQ-004` | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Empty, zero, negative, decimal, and non-numeric values all display exactly `Not Supported`. |
| `c-hex:REQ-005` | `singularity/work-items/c-hex/evidence/verification/hex-conversion-success.png`, `singularity/work-items/c-hex/evidence/verification/hex-conversion-not-supported.png` | `src/App.test.jsx` | evidence | Screenshot evidence shows the implemented browser page with a successful conversion and a `Not Supported` outcome. |
| `c-hex:AC-001` | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Entering `255` and requesting conversion displays exactly `FF`. |
| `c-hex:AC-002` | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Entering `1` and requesting conversion displays exactly `1`. |
| `c-hex:AC-003` | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Supported results use uppercase characters and omit the `0x` prefix. |
| `c-hex:AC-004` | `src/App.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | new | Empty, `0`, negative, decimal, and non-numeric input each display exactly `Not Supported`. |
| `c-hex:AC-005` | `singularity/work-items/c-hex/evidence/verification/hex-conversion-success.png`, `singularity/work-items/c-hex/evidence/verification/hex-conversion-not-supported.png` | `src/App.test.jsx` | evidence | Retained screenshots show at least one supported result and the `Not Supported` outcome. |

## Risks and rollback

The primary risks are implementing validation incorrectly, such as accepting `0`, decimals, or non-numeric input, and introducing precision loss by converting through `Number`. Focused browser regression tests cover unsupported classes, output formatting, and an exact value above `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`; retained screenshots cover the visible supported and unsupported outcomes. If the UI or validation logic drifts from specification, the rollback path is to revert the conversion-only changes in the app entry file while keeping the rest of the calculator behavior unchanged; no authentication, persistence, or conversion-history work is coupled to the feature.
