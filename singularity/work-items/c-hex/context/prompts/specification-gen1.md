# Active Story phase contract: Specification

- Work ID: `c-hex`
- Work type: `spec-driven-standard`
- Phase: `specification`
- Generation to author: 1
- Generation requirement: `required`
- Default publication producer: `governed-agent`
- Allowed publication producers: `governed-agent`, `human`
- Required publication channel: `copilot-host`
- Clarification mode: `required`
- Clarification authority: this pinned mode overrides generic skill, agent, and template guidance.
- Exact publication command: `singularity-flow phase publish specification --authored governed-agent --channel copilot-host`
- Publication boundary: Use the exact configured producer, channel, and command. Never substitute a convenient authorship route.
- Repository root: `.` (the verified current repository checkout)
- Work-item directory: `singularity/work-items/c-hex`
- Required artifact: `singularity/work-items/c-hex/artifacts/specification/spec.md`
- Authored content: at least 400 UTF-8 bytes; managed metadata and approved-input blocks do not count.
- Required Markdown headings: none beyond the configured template.
- Completion rule: replace every TODO, TBD, unresolved template marker, and configured forbidden placeholder; an unchanged prepared template is refused.
- Recovery rule: author substantive governed content; byte padding alone is not completion.
- Path boundary: Resolve every named path inside the work-item directory or repository root. Never search the filesystem outside this repository.
- Write scope: `artifact-only`
- Intelligence: world-model=`inherit`, AST=`available on request; ordinary repository file access is the default`, agent-briefs=`inherit`
- Approval authority groups: `product-approvers`
- Minimum distinct approvals: 1

## Configured artifact template

# Specification — c-hex

<!--
Scenarios come first, and general requirements come after them `[SPK:REQ-068]`. That ordering is the
template's opinion: a requirement written before anyone has described the situation it serves tends
to describe the system instead of the need, and nobody notices until verification.

Where the current Story evidence leaves something material unknown, say so with a marker rather
than guessing. Use this syntax:

    [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <one question grounded in the current Story evidence>]

Replace the angle-bracketed placeholder; never copy or ask it as written. The question must be one
non-empty line and must arise from the pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world
model, or a contradiction among them. Markers are extracted the same way clauses are, so a marker
inside fenced or inline code is ignored `[SPK:REQ-063]`. This phase blocks publication while any
marker is unresolved, and a marker is only resolved when a later generation removes it *and* records
the answer `[SPK:REQ-067]` — deleting the text alone is an integrity failure, not an answer.
-->

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the approved intent for downstream agents in a compact, standalone form. Include the
problem, intended outcome, principal actors, most important scenarios, hard constraints, and major
exclusions. Do not introduce claims that are absent from the sections below. Exact requirements and
boundary conditions are preserved separately by the governed projection.
-->

## Actors

Who uses this, and what authority does each hold?

## User scenarios

Prioritized. Each scenario leads with the situation, then its acceptance cases.

### S1 — <the most important situation, in the user's words>

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** <role>
**Context:** <what is true before this begins>

- **Given** <the starting state>
  **When** <the actor does this>
  **Then** <the observable outcome>

- **Given** <a variation worth stating>
  **When** <…>
  **Then** <…>

### S2 — <the next situation>

**Priority:** P2

- **Given** … **When** … **Then** …

## Failure and empty states

What happens the first time, with nothing there yet, and when each step fails. These are where
specifications are usually silent and implementations usually improvise.

- **Empty:** <no records yet>
- **Failure:** <the dependency is unavailable>
- **Partial:** <some of it worked>

## Permissions

Who may do each thing, and what a reader without that authority sees instead.

## Boundary conditions

Limits, sizes, counts, timeouts, and what happens exactly at and beyond each one.

## Requirements

Numbered, testable, one obligation each. Cite the scenario each serves.

- <requirement>. *(S1)* [c-hex:REQ-001]
- <requirement>. *(S1, S2)* [c-hex:REQ-002]

Acceptance criteria use the same stable, namespaced form:

- <observable acceptance outcome>. *(S1)* [c-hex:AC-001]

## Non-functional requirements

Latency, throughput, availability, accessibility, privacy, retention. State the number and how it
will be measured; "fast" is not a requirement.

Use governed requirement anchors here too (for example `[c-hex:REQ-003]`); `NFR-001` by
itself is only a display label and is not a stable clause identity.

## Constitution articles

Cite the article IDs this specification is bound by `[SPK:REQ-100]`. The kernel validates that each
cited ID exists at the pinned revision before publication `[SPK:REQ-101]`.

- <ART-…>

## Assumptions

What this specification takes as true without proving. An assumption that turns out false is a
change request, not a defect — which is only true if it was written down.

## Out of scope

Named explicitly, so the boundary is reviewable rather than inferred.

## Sources

Each supporting document this specification relies on, cited as `DOC-nnn — <name>`, and each one
offered to this phase that could not be read or was not available here, named as a gap. Without
supporting documents, say so.

# Pinned Story source

- Immutable source: `singularity/work-items/c-hex/source.json`
- SHA-256: `972d97c67c21b23e94b63363d0c2a32bc66c5ac36061896b5654950b78ccfee8`
- Authority: this is the requested outcome. Later evidence may refine missing detail but may not silently contradict or replace it.
- Conflict recovery: confirm the intent change with the human. After scope approval, any active phase in any workflow can use `singularity-flow story intent-amendment propose --file <FILE> --reason "<REASON>"`; no convergence finding or revision loop is required. Recompose after authorized approval and acknowledgement. Before scope approval, record the human change in clarification and revise/review the scope draft normally; never rewrite this pinned source.

```json
{
  "type": "manual",
  "id": "c-hex",
  "title": "hex",
  "description": "implemement hex",
  "acceptanceCriteria": "screenshit"
}
```

# Human clarification checkpoint

The `specification` phase uses clarification mode `required`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: scope, acceptance criteria, actors, boundary conditions, non-functional requirements.

- This checkpoint is required. Pause for at least one human response before authoring.
- If the evidence appears complete, ask the user to confirm your concise interpretation of the intended outcome, boundaries, and acceptance criteria rather than silently continuing.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 5 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Do not re-ask established facts or infer answers from generic knowledge. Label hypotheses/design proposals; they become acceptance or specification decisions only with human confirmation.
- For intent conflicts, confirm the human change and follow Conflict recovery in the Pinned Story source; never silently overwrite intent.
- Explain each question’s impact; offer an evidence-supported default. Accept explicit “unknown” or non-blocking deferral. Record confirmed decisions in the artifact and deferred items in Open questions with impact and owner.
- Stage only {"responses":[...]} at the Git-private path returned by `git rev-parse --git-path singularity-flow/clarification-responses/specification-gen<N>.json`, then run `singularity-flow clarification record specification --response-file <that-path>` and remove the staging file after success. Never write response input to the CLI-owned `singularity/work-items/**/context/clarifications-*.json` durable path.
- Material unresolved decisions block specification publication; recommendations/placeholders cannot hide them.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication; never assume answers.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Product owner agent

Resolve the active Story checkout from this invocation's verified phase-entry packet; otherwise run `singularity-flow session current --json`. Do not repeat a supplied boundary lookup. Require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. If no Story is attached, use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; stop if neither resolves. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Use CLI-returned `workItemRoot` and artifact or packet paths for governed Story reads and writes; keep them within the bound `workId`.

Use pinned business sources, the repository business view, and approved upstream artifacts as evidence. State the user, problem, outcome, scope, exclusions, dependencies, assumptions, and measurable success criteria. Convert evidence into stable `REQ-nnn` requirements and testable `AC-nnn` acceptance criteria with exact citations. Separate confirmed needs, proposals, and unresolved questions. Do not invent business intent or grant approval.

Follow the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification checkpoint before authoring; its mode and recording instructions override generic agent guidance. When clarification is allowed, focus on the intended outcome, scope boundaries, and acceptance criteria.

# Repository world-model status

- Availability: `unavailable` (`WMB_EARLIER_BUILD_MODEL_INCOMPATIBLE`)
- This is not a lifecycle blocker. Continue with the pinned Story source, approved phase inputs, and ordinary repository file access.
- Do not invent or reconstruct world-model facts. A contributor may build or repair the shared model separately.

# Final clarification guard

The pinned clarification mode for `specification` is `required`; this instruction overrides conflicting generic skill, agent, template, or repository prose.
Complete the required interactive clarification checkpoint and its governed response record before authoring.
