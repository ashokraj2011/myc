# Active Story phase contract: Implementation

- Work ID: `1claude-hex`
- Requested outcome: hex — implement hex operator on calculator .It should covert an postive integer to hex value ,for all others it should show not supported in the screen (full request: Pinned Story source below)
- Work type: `spec-driven-standard`
- Phase: `implementation`
- Generation to author: 1
- Changes allowed: May edit this phase's artifacts and application paths within pinned policy; protected and governed state remain kernel-owned.
- Code-edit prerequisite: the exact generation is open; verify the entry mutationContract before edits. Binding `ready` is not code-edit permission.
- Code completion: preserve existing implementation and tests on resume. Complete the configured implementation summary and Agent brief, reconcile exact planned source/test paths and traceability, then prepublish. Passing a manual test command does not publish the phase or justify ending with no next action.
- Generation requirement: `required`
- Default publication producer: `governed-agent`
- Allowed publication producers: `governed-agent`, `human`
- Required publication channel: `copilot-host`
- Clarification mode: `when-needed`
- Clarification authority: this pinned mode overrides generic skill, agent, and template guidance.
- Exact publication command: `singularity-flow phase publish implementation --authored governed-agent --channel copilot-host`
- Publication boundary: Use the exact configured producer, channel, and command. Never substitute a convenient authorship route.
- Repair boundary: the configured producer repairs this open draft in place; regenerate kernel-owned artifacts, never hand-edit them. Draft defects do not forbid repairs. Preserve prior approved artifacts and decisions; never re-author an earlier phase to satisfy a new template. Publication and any configured approvals remain separate checks.
- Readiness: advisories are not current blockers. Documentation comments need no human approval; unplanned-path advice names work to account for before approval. When prepublish is ready and returns commands.publish, continue that publication attempt; required tests still run there. A resolved runner does not require editing package scripts just to emit its configured report.
- Upstream discrepancies: approved earlier-phase artifacts are fixed evidence. If one is wrong, incomplete or contradicts another input or the pinned source, do not edit it and do not stop: continue on the most conservative reading consistent with the pinned source, and list each item under `## Upstream discrepancies` (producer phase, exact clause or section, problem, assumption used, impact, proposed owner action), then file them once with `singularity-flow upstream-issue raise --from-artifact`; the producer's approvers decide them. Stop only for a refusal about changed or unapproved input bytes (use its restore or return route), or when no reading satisfies the pinned source.
- Configuration: manifests, lockfiles and build/test/CI/runtime settings are configuration, never product code or executable test declarations. Do not add code traceability tags or API documentation to them. Account for tooling under Supporting files with a reason, or use fulfillment configuration for a requirement changing runtime settings. Keep these bytes in scope review, candidate hashes and required tests; governed configuration still uses its separate authority.
- Repository root: `.` (the verified current repository checkout)
- Work-item directory: `singularity/work-items/1claude-hex`
- Required artifact: `singularity/work-items/1claude-hex/artifacts/implementation/implementation-summary.md`
- Authored content: at least 250 UTF-8 bytes; managed metadata and approved-input blocks do not count.
- Required Markdown headings: none beyond the configured template.
- Completion rule: replace every TODO, TBD, unresolved template marker, and configured forbidden placeholder; an unchanged prepared template is refused.
- Recovery rule: author substantive governed content; byte padding alone is not completion.
- Path boundary: Resolve every named path inside the work-item directory or repository root. Never search the filesystem outside this repository.
- Write scope: `source-and-artifact`
- Intelligence: world-model=`inherit`, AST=`available on request; ordinary repository file access is the default`, agent-briefs=`inherit`
- Approval authority groups: `engineering-reviewers`
- Minimum distinct approvals: 1

# 1claude-hex — Implementation Summary

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the implemented outcome, consequential decisions, changed surfaces, validation result,
remaining limitations, and rollout considerations for downstream agents. Keep it evidence-based;
the detailed changed-components and test sections are preserved separately.
-->

## Implemented outcome

TODO: Summarize the implemented behavior.

## Changed components and decisions

TODO: Cite exact changed product-source paths and the qualified `@clause:1claude-hex:REQ-001`-style comments that bind applicable planned clauses to implementation. Explain configuration, migrations, deviations, and reviewed test-only or non-code dispositions. A tag alone is not proof of behavior.

## Tests and operational notes

TODO: List executable tests tagged with qualified `@ac:1claude-hex:AC-001` IDs, exact commands and observed results, limitations, flags, and rollout notes. Test tags belong in test files; source-bound clause tags belong in product source.

- Authority: this is the requested outcome. Later evidence may refine missing detail but may not silently contradict or replace it.
- Conflict recovery: confirm the intent change with the human. After scope approval, any active phase in any workflow can use `singularity-flow story intent-amendment propose --file <FILE> --reason "<REASON>"`; no convergence finding or revision loop is required.

# Human clarification checkpoint

The `implementation` phase uses clarification mode `when-needed`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: approved deviations, implementation blockers.

- Ask only when a material ambiguity remains after reading the governed evidence.
- If none remains, state that the clarification checkpoint found no material ambiguity and continue.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 3 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world model, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Formulating evidence-grounded questions is permitted even while artifact authoring awaits clarification. Never ask the human to supply the questions or generic clarification answers. A menu promise to provide answers is not an answer.
- Do not re-ask established facts or infer answers from generic knowledge. Label hypotheses/design proposals; they become acceptance or specification decisions only with human confirmation.
- Missing record does not mean unanswered. Reuse actual human replies only for the same Story, phase, generation and reviewed context. A failed tool/record write requires recording repair, not repeated questions; preserve the replies and staging file on failure. Changed bindings require review, never automatic answer adoption.
- For intent conflicts, confirm the human change and follow Conflict recovery in the Pinned Story source; never silently overwrite intent.
- Explain each question’s impact; offer an evidence-supported default. Accept explicit “unknown” or non-blocking deferral. Record confirmed decisions in the artifact and deferred items in Open questions with impact and owner.
- Use a file-edit tool to stage only {"responses":[...]} at the issued responseStagingPath (standalone discovery: `git rev-parse --git-path singularity-flow/clarification-responses/implementation-gen<N>.json`). Run the returned recordAction or standalone `singularity-flow clarification record implementation --response-file <that-path>`, without shell chains, then remove staging with a file-edit tool only after success. Never write response input to the CLI-owned `singularity/work-items/**/context/clarifications-*.json` durable path.
- Material unresolved decisions block specification publication; recommendations/placeholders cannot hide them.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication; never assume answers.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Developer agent

Resolve the active Story checkout from this invocation's verified entry packet. The canonical skill owns pause/binding; do not preflight it again. Without a skill entry, run `singularity-flow session current --for-agent --json` once and obey `paused`. Require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as cwd for every shell and file tool. If no Story is attached, use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; stop if neither resolves. Never search `$HOME`, a parent directory, or outside that repository. Use CLI-returned `workItemRoot` and artifact or packet paths for governed Story reads and writes; keep them within the bound `workId`.

Restate the approved objective and applicable acceptance/specification items. Inspect governed repository evidence before changing code. Prefer the smallest coherent change that follows existing boundaries, conventions, error handling, and tests. Do not expand scope or silently resolve ambiguity. Record changed files, commands actually run, evidence, residual risk, and approved deviations.

When the composed phase prompt includes bounded structural context from a compatible extractor, use a focused AST query before broad text search for symbol, import, or relationship discovery: `singularity-flow wm ast query --predicate symbol|import|language|path --value <VALUE> --max-facts 50 --max-output-bytes 32768 --json`, or the equivalent `wm.ast.query` gateway read. If the prompt reports no structural facts, an unsupported language, text-only assurance, or unavailable AST, continue with ordinary repository file access without retrying AST. Follow `nextCursor` only while the question remains unanswered. Treat `text` assurance as a search lead, never proof that a declaration exists; syntax or semantic claims require the named extractor recorded in the result.

Follow the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification checkpoint before authoring; its mode and recording instructions override generic agent guidance. When clarification is allowed, focus on implementation blockers or approved-specification deviations. Do not reopen settled product or architecture choices.

- Producer: `specification` generation 1

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Calculator users can convert the current value immediately with a `hex` control in the scientific keypad toolbar. Positive whole numbers display as uppercase hexadecimal digits without a `0x` prefix. Empty input, zero, negative values, fractions, and non-numeric values display exactly `Not supported`. Acceptance requires automated tests for those input classes and fresh screenshots of a successful conversion and an unsupported-input state.

## Actors

The actor is a calculator user. No distinct permission or role is required by this Story.

## User scenarios

Prioritized. Each scenario leads with the situation, then its acceptance cases.

### S1 — Convert a positive integer to a hexadecimal value

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator is open, the scientific keypad is available, and a positive whole-number value is current.

- **Given** the current value is `255`
  **When** the user presses the `hex` control
  **Then** the calculator immediately displays `FF`, with no `0x` prefix, without requiring `=`.

- **Given** the current value is another positive whole number
  **When** the user presses the `hex` control
  **Then** the calculator immediately displays that value's uppercase hexadecimal digits.

### S2 — Reject values that are not positive whole numbers

**Priority:** P2
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator is open and the current input is empty or is not a positive whole number.

- **Given** the current value is `0`, a negative number, or a fractional number
  **When** the user presses the `hex` control
  **Then** the calculator displays exactly `Not supported`.

- **Given** the current input is empty
  **When** the user presses the `hex` control
  **Then** the calculator displays exactly `Not supported`.

- **Given** the current input is non-numeric
  **When** the user presses the `hex` control
  **Then** the calculator displays exactly `Not supported`.

## Failure and empty states

What happens the first time, with nothing there yet, and when each step fails. These are where
specifications are usually silent and implementations usually improvise.

- **Empty:** Pressing `hex` with no current input displays `Not supported`.
- **Failure:** A value that cannot be converted because it is zero, negative, fractional, or non-numeric displays `Not supported`. The Story defines no separate dependency or service failure state for this local conversion.
- **Partial:** No partial outcome is defined; the conversion either displays the hexadecimal value or `Not supported`.

## Permissions

The feature is available to the calculator user. The Story specifies no role-based access or permission change.

## Boundary conditions

A supported input is a whole-number value greater than zero. Zero, any negative value, any fractional value, empty input, and non-numeric input are unsupported and display exactly `Not supported`. A supported result uses uppercase A–F and has no `0x` prefix. The control is in the scientific keypad toolbar and converts immediately.

## Requirements

Numbered, testable, one obligation each. Cite the scenario each serves.

- Pressing the `hex` control in the scientific keypad toolbar immediately converts the current positive whole-number value and displays its hexadecimal digits using uppercase A–F, without a `0x` prefix or requiring `=`. *(S1)* [1claude-hex:REQ-001]
- Pressing the `hex` control for zero, a negative value, a fractional value, empty input, or non-numeric input displays exactly `Not supported`. *(S2)* [1claude-hex:REQ-002]

Acceptance criteria use the same stable, namespaced form:

- Acceptance evidence includes fresh screenshots of a successful hexadecimal conversion and the `Not supported` state, plus automated tests covering positive whole numbers and each unsupported input class: zero, negative, fractional, empty, and non-numeric. *(S1, S2)* [1claude-hex:AC-001]

## Non-functional requirements

Latency, throughput, availability, accessibility, privacy, retention. State the number and how it
will be measured; "fast" is not a requirement.

No non-functional requirement is specified by the pinned Story or clarification answers.

## Assumptions

What this specification takes as true without proving. An assumption that turns out false is a
change request, not a defect — which is only true if it was written down.

The `hex` control acts on the current calculator value. The Story does not define behavior for entering or converting compound expressions; this specification covers the current value only. No further unresolved decision is recorded for this generation.

## Out of scope

Named explicitly, so the boundary is reviewable rather than inferred.

Binary, octal, or other base conversions; changes to ordinary arithmetic or other scientific functions; and a `0x` prefix are out of scope.

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a focused positive-integer-to-hex conversion helper to the calculator utilities, wire a `hex`
action through the scientific keypad to App-owned display state, and leave the existing expression
evaluator and other keypad modes unchanged. Unit and App interaction tests will cover the supported
conversion and every specified unsupported input. Retain fresh screenshots of the `255` → `FF`
success state and the exact `Not supported` state. Main risks are misclassifying numeric input and
accidentally changing existing expression, history, or keypad behavior; constrain the handler to
the current scalar value and test the existing calculation flow as regression coverage.

## Test strategy

Use utility tests for positive whole-number formatting and rejection boundaries, plus App
interaction tests for the scientific toolbar, immediate display update, and each unsupported input.
Keep test files separate from product-source paths. Capture fresh screenshots from the running
candidate for the two visual states; screenshot presence is not itself a visual pass. The approved
criterion also requires automated tests for positive whole numbers, zero, negative, fractional,
empty, and non-numeric input.

## Risks and rollback

Input parsing could accept an unsupported value or reject a valid positive integer; unit tests must
cover all five unsupported classes and representative positive whole numbers, while App tests
confirm the exact user-visible result. Wiring the action could disturb standard keypad, arithmetic,
or history behavior; retain the existing regression suite and avoid changing those flows. The
approved specification does not define compound-expression conversion, so this plan limits the
feature to the current scalar input rather than silently adding evaluation semantics. If the
feature regresses existing behavior, revert only the hex toolbar callback, handler, helper, and
feature tests/evidence; leave unrelated calculator changes untouched.

# Governed execution evidence

Use retainedExecutionEvidence for governed command outcomes, not earlier authored prose or IDE test discovery. An IDE "No tests found" is a separate discovery failure, not a failed governed run or a pass. Current source/test-input bindings must match before reusing results; command success alone proves neither every criterion nor visual acceptance. Reconcile contradictions explicitly in this draft, citing the packet, generation and source; preserve approved reports and decisions. If policy requires new execution or a prior-phase correction, follow the returned human/rework route, never relabel partial evidence as matched.

# Final clarification guard

The pinned clarification mode for `implementation` is `when-needed`; this instruction overrides conflicting generic skill, agent, template, or repository prose.
Ask and record a bounded batch only if material ambiguity remains after governed evidence is read; otherwise continue without a clarification record.
