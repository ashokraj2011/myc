# Implementation plan — hex-1978

Derived from the approved specification. Cite the clause each decision serves, so convergence can
join intent to implementation at requirement altitude rather than by path `[SPK:REQ-071]`.

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the selected approach, affected surfaces, sequencing, proof strategy, and principal risks
for downstream agents. Keep exact commands and source paths when they are operationally important.
The complete approved plan remains available through its hash-bound expansion reference.
-->

Add a `hex` action to the existing calculator keypad and handle conversion in the shared calculator state in `src/App.jsx`. Keep it available in standard and scientific modes through their shared keypad component. Add an App interaction test for the approved decimal `2` to hexadecimal `2` example and retain the required screenshot at `singularity/work-items/hex-1978/evidence/hex-result-2.png`. Do not extend behavior for zero, negative, or non-integer inputs. The main risks are affecting existing calculator state or exposing the action in only one mode; the interaction test and visual review address those risks. [HEX-1978:REQ-001] [HEX-1978:REQ-002] [HEX-1978:AC-001] [HEX-1978:AC-002]

## Approach

Implement conversion as an explicit user action against the currently displayed positive decimal integer, rather than changing expression evaluation or introducing a separate arithmetic mode. Put the action in the shared keypad component and update the result using the existing App state/display flow. Preserve existing entry and calculation behavior. The approved example is decimal `2` producing `2`; no prefix, extra formatting, numeric limit, or behavior for out-of-scope inputs is specified. [HEX-1978:REQ-001] [HEX-1978:REQ-002]

## Affected surfaces

The change is limited to the shared App state/callback and keypad control, with an App interaction test and a retained screenshot. The keypad is used by both standard and scientific modes. No API, persistence, or data-model change is planned. These expected paths are planning aids; reconciliation remains authoritative. [HEX-1978:REQ-001] [HEX-1978:REQ-002] [HEX-1978:AC-001] [HEX-1978:AC-002]

| Surface | Change | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `src/App.jsx` | Add conversion handling against the current displayed value and pass it to keypad controls. | [HEX-1978:REQ-001] |
| `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | Expose the `hex` action and invoke the shared handler. | [HEX-1978:REQ-001] [HEX-1978:REQ-002] |
| `src/App.test.jsx` | Exercise the button and verify decimal `2` displays hexadecimal `2`. | [HEX-1978:AC-002] [HEX-1978:REQ-001] [HEX-1978:REQ-002] |
| `singularity/work-items/hex-1978/evidence/hex-result-2.png` | Retain the calculator screenshot showing the specified result. | [HEX-1978:AC-001] |

## Sequencing

1. Add the shared conversion handler in `src/App.jsx` and pass it to the calculator keypad. [HEX-1978:REQ-001]
2. Add the labeled action in `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx`, shared by standard and scientific modes. [HEX-1978:REQ-002]
3. Add the UI interaction regression in `src/App.test.jsx` to verify the `hex` label and conversion of `2` to `2`. [HEX-1978:AC-002]
4. Run the specified scenario and retain a screenshot at `singularity/work-items/hex-1978/evidence/hex-result-2.png` for visual review. [HEX-1978:AC-001]

## Test strategy

Prove conversion and control behavior with the App-level interaction test. Retain and visually review a screenshot independently for AC-001; file presence alone is not a passing visual review. No test result or screenshot is claimed by this plan. [HEX-1978:AC-001] [HEX-1978:AC-002] [HEX-1978:REQ-001] [HEX-1978:REQ-002]

| Clause | Expected paths | Planned tests | Fulfillment | Observable result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HEX-1978:AC-001` | `singularity/work-items/hex-1978/evidence/hex-result-2.png` | `src/App.test.jsx` | evidence | Screenshot shows hexadecimal result `2` for decimal input `2`; visual review uses the retained screenshot. |
| `HEX-1978:AC-002` | `src/App.jsx` `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | modified | Test activates the `hex` button after entering `2` and observes result `2`. |
| `HEX-1978:REQ-001` | `src/App.jsx` `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | modified | Activating `hex` converts the displayed positive decimal integer and updates the result. |
| `HEX-1978:REQ-002` | `src/components/StandardKeypad.jsx` | `src/App.test.jsx` | modified | The calculator exposes a button labeled `hex` in standard and scientific modes. |

<!-- Fulfillment: new, modified, existing (behaviour already at the listed paths), removed, test-only (tests are the whole delivery; Expected paths is -), document, configuration, or evidence (retained files under this Story's evidence/ directory). Do not put screenshots in Planned tests or product-source rows. An evidence AC needs a primary visual/inspection Verification contract; file presence is not a visual pass. Observable result states what is observed. Multi-code-step plans add Steps to allocate each row. -->

## Verification contracts

<!-- Optional for default automated tests, required for retained screenshot/inspection criteria.
Use a Criterion | Slot | Method | Witness | Role | Required assurance table. For a screenshot AC,
its Test strategy row has Fulfillment evidence and the exact Story evidence path under Expected
paths. The contract has a primary visual (screen/scenario) or inspection (exact path) witness,
with source-bound assurance. Prose describing a "primary visual verification contract" is not
a contract row. Criterion must be an exact approved AC ID, Slot a lower-hyphen identifier,
Method test/inspection/visual, and Role primary/supporting; scenario/reviewer prose belongs
outside these cells. Never classify the screenshot as product source or an executable test. -->

| Criterion | Slot | Method | Witness | Role | Required assurance |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HEX-1978:AC-001` | hex-result | visual | `singularity/work-items/hex-1978/evidence/hex-result-2.png` | primary | source-bound |

## Supporting files

<!-- Optional. List each file the code may change that cannot carry a @clause tag (a manifest, a lockfile, CI configuration, repository metadata, documentation): one exact backticked repository path per bullet, then its reason, for example: - `go.mod` — adds the ledger client, or - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — runs the new job. Application source, tests and migrations are never supporting files: give them a clause row. Approval refuses any other changed path no clause claims. Delete this section when there are none. -->

## Constitution articles

None: this Story pinned no constitution.

## Risks and rollback

The handler could use stale state or update only one mode; test through the UI and verify the displayed result, and visually review the retained screenshot. If normal digit entry, arithmetic, or unrelated keypad behavior regresses, revert the scoped handler/keypad/test changes and run the existing regression suite. Do not invent error handling or behavior for zero, negative, or non-integer values, which remain out of scope. [HEX-1978:REQ-001] [HEX-1978:REQ-002] [HEX-1978:AC-001] [HEX-1978:AC-002]

## Summary from “Agent brief”

Add a `hex` button to the calculator so a user can convert a displayed positive decimal integer to its hexadecimal value. The confirmed acceptance example is decimal `2`, whose hexadecimal result is `2`; the requested verification includes a screenshot of that result and a test for the button and conversion. Negative, zero, and non-integer inputs are outside the confirmed scope. No additional formatting, error behavior, or numeric limit is specified.

## Actors

The calculator user invokes the conversion. No separate roles or permissions are specified.

## User scenarios

                                                                                               
                                                                                              
                                                                                                   
                                                                                                  
                                                                                               
                                                                                              
                                                                                                   

### S1 — Convert a positive integer to hexadecimal

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator displays the positive decimal integer `2`.

- **Given** the calculator displays decimal `2`
  **When** the user activates the `hex` button
  **Then** the calculator displays its hexadecimal value, `2`.

## Failure and empty states

- **Empty:** Behavior with no displayed positive integer is not specified.
- **Failure:** No conversion failure behavior is specified for the in-scope positive integer input.
- **Partial:** Not applicable; the confirmed scenario is one calculator display conversion with no described external side effects.

## Permissions

Not applicable: the Story specifies a calculator operation and no role-based access.

## Boundary conditions

The confirmed input domain is positive integers. The requested example is decimal `2`. Zero, negative, and non-integer inputs are outside the confirmed scope; their behavior is not specified. No maximum positive integer or additional output-format convention is specified.

## Requirements

- Activating the calculator's `hex` button converts the currently displayed positive decimal integer to its hexadecimal value. *(S1)* [HEX-1978:REQ-001]
- The calculator UI exposes a button labeled `hex` for requesting that conversion. *(S1)* [HEX-1978:REQ-002]

Acceptance criteria use the same stable, namespaced form:

- A screenshot of the calculator shows the hexadecimal result `2` for decimal input `2`. *(S1)* [HEX-1978:AC-001] [scope:SRI-77b88f6611a7]
- An executable test verifies that the calculator exposes the `hex` button and that activating it for decimal input `2` displays hexadecimal `2`. *(S1)* [HEX-1978:AC-002] [scope:SRI-77b88f6611a7]

## Non-functional requirements

Not applicable: no non-functional requirements are stated in the pinned request or recorded clarification.

## Assumptions

The `hex` button acts on the calculator's currently displayed value. The requested conversion is from a positive decimal integer to its base-16 value.

## Out of scope

Negative, zero, and non-integer input behavior; hexadecimal arithmetic mode; output prefixes or formatting beyond the specified result `2`; and any numeric maximum are not specified by this Story.
