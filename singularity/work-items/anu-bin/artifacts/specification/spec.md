# Specification — anu-bin

<!--
Scenarios come first, and general requirements come after them `[SPK:REQ-068]`. That ordering is the
template's opinion: a requirement written before anyone has described the situation it serves tends
to describe the system instead of the need, and nobody notices until verification.

Where the current Story evidence leaves something material unknown, say so with a marker rather
than guessing. Use this syntax:

    [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <one question grounded in the current Story evidence>]

Replace the angle-bracketed placeholder; never copy or ask it as written. The question must be one
non-empty line and must arise from the pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world
model, or a contradiction among them. Markers are extracted the same way clauses are, so a marker
inside fenced or inline code is ignored `[SPK:REQ-063]`. This phase blocks publication while any
marker is unresolved, and a marker is only resolved when a later generation removes it *and* records
the answer `[SPK:REQ-067]` — deleting the text alone is an integrity failure, not an answer.
-->

Keep every section of this template. When one does not fit this change (for example Permissions
for a library or command-line tool with no roles), write `Not applicable: <reason>` under it
rather than deleting it: later steps carry Actors, Failure and empty states, Permissions,
Boundary conditions and the other sections forward, and stop when one is missing.

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the approved intent for downstream agents in a compact, standalone form. Include the
problem, intended outcome, principal actors, most important scenarios, hard constraints, and major
exclusions. Do not introduce claims that are absent from the sections below. Exact requirements and
boundary conditions are preserved separately by the governed projection.
-->

Enable a calculator user to convert a decimal value to its binary value. Unit tests are the stated acceptance evidence. The confirmed scope does not define input limits, fractional-value handling, or presentation details; do not assume additional behavior.

## Actors

The calculator user supplies a decimal value and requests its evaluation. No other actor or authority is specified.

## User scenarios

Prioritized. Each scenario leads with the situation, then its acceptance cases.

<!-- Before drafting, split the pinned request and recorded answers into observable obligations
for the actual interfaces (UI, API, event/message, batch/job, CLI, library or mixed). Keep the
source -> REQ/AC -> assertion -> verification mapping in the existing sections. Existing ACs count;
do not duplicate clauses or invent controls, endpoints, limits, errors or screenshot requirements.
Self-check whether an implementation could meet this draft yet omit an explicit request. Repair
clear omissions in this editable draft and recheck within the returned repair policy; preserve
published inputs and settled answers. These are authoring instructions, not execution evidence. -->

### S1 — Convert a decimal value in the calculator

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The user has a decimal value to evaluate.

- **Given** the calculator user supplies a decimal value
  **When** the user evaluates that value in the calculator
  **Then** the calculator provides the value in binary.

## Failure and empty states

The pinned request and clarification do not specify empty-input, conversion-failure, or partial-result behavior. These outcomes remain unspecified.

## Scenario coverage

<!-- One row per behavior/acceptance clause; repeat rows for multiple outcomes. Every referenced
S-number must have complete Given/When/Then acceptance cases above. Outcome is success, failure,
boundary, or empty. Rejection/error requirements need distinct failure cases, not only happy-path
prose. Use the pinned request and clarification answers; do not invent error text or new scope. -->

| Clause | Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `ANU-BIN:REQ-001` | S1 | success |
| `ANU-BIN:AC-001` | S1 | success |

## Permissions

Not applicable: the Story specifies calculator use and no permission or access-control behavior.

## Boundary conditions

The Story does not define numeric limits, fractional-value handling, or other boundary behavior.

## Requirements

The calculator shall convert a supplied decimal value to its corresponding binary value when evaluated. *(S1)* [ANU-BIN:REQ-001]

Acceptance criteria use the same stable, namespaced form:

- Unit tests shall verify the calculator's decimal-to-binary conversion behavior. *(S1)* [ANU-BIN:AC-001] [scope:SRI-bf17ce947d7f]

## Verification intent

<!-- One row per declared clause, including non-functional requirements. Methods: test, visual,
inspection, or a comma-separated combination (all required). AC Criterion is its own ID. A
visual/inspection requirement names the AC proving it; a test-only requirement may use -. An AC a
requirement names lists every method that requirement lists: a `test, visual` requirement needs a
`test, visual` AC. Choose from the pinned source, not from available tools. A screenshot is visual
proof, not a test exemption.
Planning must inherit these methods and cannot change them without an approved scope amendment. -->

| Clause | Methods | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| `ANU-BIN:REQ-001` | test | `ANU-BIN:AC-001` |
| `ANU-BIN:AC-001` | test | `ANU-BIN:AC-001` |

## Non-functional requirements

No non-functional requirements are specified by the pinned Story or confirmed clarification.

Use governed requirement anchors here too (for example `[ANU-BIN:REQ-003]`); `NFR-001` by
itself is only a display label and is not a stable clause identity.

## Constitution articles

None: this Story pinned no constitution.

## Assumptions

The calculator accepts a decimal value for evaluation. The Story and clarification leave numeric limits, fractional handling, and output presentation unspecified; no behavior for those details is asserted here.

## Out of scope

No additional conversion modes or behaviors are specified. The unspecified numeric and presentation details above are not silently constrained by this specification.

## Sources

Pinned Story source: `singularity/work-items/anu-bin/source.json` (request: “Convert a decimal value to binary value in calc”; acceptance criterion: “Unit test cases”). Clarification response for specification generation 1 confirmed the proposed interpretation and that unmentioned details remain unspecified. No supporting documents were supplied.
