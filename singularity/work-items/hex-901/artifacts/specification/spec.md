# Specification — hex-901

<!--
Scenarios come first, and general requirements come after them `[SPK:REQ-068]`. That ordering is the
template's opinion: a requirement written before anyone has described the situation it serves tends
to describe the system instead of the need, and nobody notices until verification.

Where the current Story evidence leaves something material unknown, say so with a marker rather
than guessing. Use this syntax:

    [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: <one question grounded in the current Story evidence>]

Replace the angle-bracketed placeholder; never copy or ask it as written. The question must be one
non-empty line and must arise from the pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository world
model, or a contradiction among them. Markers are extracted the same way clauses are, so a marker
inside fenced or inline code is ignored `[SPK:REQ-063]`. This phase blocks publication while any
marker is unresolved, and a marker is only resolved when a later generation removes it *and* records
the answer `[SPK:REQ-067]` — deleting the text alone is an integrity failure, not an answer.
-->

Keep every section of this template. When one does not fit this change (for example Permissions
for a library or command-line tool with no roles), write `Not applicable: <reason>` under it
rather than deleting it: later steps carry Actors, Failure and empty states, Permissions,
Boundary conditions and the other sections forward, and stop when one is missing.

## Agent brief

<!--
Summarize the approved intent for downstream agents in a compact, standalone form. Include the
problem, intended outcome, principal actors, most important scenarios, hard constraints, and major
exclusions. Do not introduce claims that are absent from the sections below. Exact requirements and
boundary conditions are preserved separately by the governed projection.
-->

Calculator users need to convert the current calculator value to hexadecimal. The confirmed scope
is positive integers; the converted value is displayed without a `0x` prefix. For the required
example, 16 displays as `10`. Acceptance includes tests of positive-integer conversions and a
screenshot of the 16-to-`10` state. The exact control placement and A-F letter casing are unspecified.

## Confirmed clarification

- Convert the current calculator value to a hexadecimal representation.
- Support positive integers only; the user did not include fractional values.
- Display `10` without a prefix for the value 16.
- Tests should cover positive-number conversions, and the screenshot should show the hexadecimal
  value of 16.

## Actors

Who uses this, and what authority does each hold?

- **Calculator user:** invokes the hex operation on the current calculator value. No distinct role
  or permission level was specified.

## User scenarios

Prioritized. Each scenario leads with the situation, then its acceptance cases.

<!-- Before drafting, split the pinned request and recorded answers into observable obligations
for the actual interfaces (UI, API, event/message, batch/job, CLI, library or mixed). Keep the
source -> REQ/AC -> assertion -> verification mapping in the existing sections. Existing ACs count;
do not duplicate clauses or invent controls, endpoints, limits, errors or screenshot requirements.
Self-check whether an implementation could meet this draft yet omit an explicit request. Repair
clear omissions in this editable draft and recheck within the returned repair policy; preserve
published inputs and settled answers. These are authoring instructions, not execution evidence. -->

### S1 — Convert the current positive integer to hexadecimal

**Priority:** P1
**Actor:** Calculator user
**Context:** The calculator has a current positive integer value.

- **Given** the calculator's current value is 16
  **When** the user invokes the hex operator
  **Then** the calculator displays `10`, the hexadecimal representation of 16, without a `0x`
  prefix.

- **Given** the calculator's current value is another positive integer
  **When** the user invokes the hex operator
  **Then** the calculator displays the equivalent base-16 representation of that value.

## Failure and empty states

What happens the first time, with nothing there yet, and when each step fails. These are where
specifications are usually silent and implementations usually improvise.

- **Empty:** No conversion result is specified when the calculator has no current positive integer
  value.
- **Failure:** The request specifies no dependency failure or error message for this local
  conversion; no new failure behavior is required.
- **Partial:** No partial-conversion state is specified.

## Scenario coverage

<!-- One row per behavior/acceptance clause; repeat rows for multiple outcomes. Every referenced
S-number must have complete Given/When/Then acceptance cases above. Outcome is success, failure,
boundary, or empty. Rejection/error requirements need distinct failure cases, not only happy-path
prose. Use the pinned request and clarification answers; do not invent error text or new scope. -->

| Clause | Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| `HEX-901:REQ-001` | S1 | success |
| `HEX-901:AC-001` | S1 | success |

The pinned description “Hex operator in calculator” maps to `HEX-901:REQ-001` and its observable
conversion in S1. The pinned acceptance text “screenshot and testases” maps to
`HEX-901:AC-001`: test evidence for positive-integer conversions and visual evidence of 16 displayed
as `10` without a prefix [scope:SRI-23836b6af209].

## Permissions

Who may do each thing, and what a reader without that authority sees instead.

No role or permission distinction is specified; the feature adds no authorization requirement.

## Boundary conditions

Limits, sizes, counts, timeouts, and what happens exactly at and beyond each one.

The supported conversion input domain is positive integers. Zero, negative values, and fractional
values are outside this request; their conversion behavior is not specified. The converted value
has no `0x` prefix. Letter casing for hexadecimal digits A-F is not specified; either case is
acceptable when the displayed digits represent the same value.

## Requirements

Numbered, testable, one obligation each. Cite the scenario each serves.

- When the user invokes the hex operator while the calculator's current value is a positive integer,
  display that value's equivalent base-16 representation. *(S1)* [HEX-901:REQ-001]

Acceptance criteria use the same stable, namespaced form:

- Tests verify that positive integer values convert to their equivalent hexadecimal values, and a
  screenshot shows the calculator displaying `10` without a prefix after converting 16. *(S1)*
  [HEX-901:AC-001] [scope:SRI-23836b6af209]

## Verification intent

<!-- One row per declared clause, including non-functional requirements. Methods: test, visual,
inspection, or a comma-separated combination (all required). AC Criterion is its own ID. A
visual/inspection requirement names the AC proving it; a test-only requirement may use -. Choose
from the pinned source, not from available tools. A screenshot is visual proof, not a test exemption.
Planning must inherit these methods and cannot change them without an approved scope amendment. -->

| Clause | Methods | Criterion |
|---|---|---|
| `HEX-901:REQ-001` | test | - |
| `HEX-901:AC-001` | test, visual | `HEX-901:AC-001` |

## Non-functional requirements

Latency, throughput, availability, accessibility, privacy, retention. State the number and how it
will be measured; "fast" is not a requirement.

Use governed requirement anchors here too (for example `[HEX-901:REQ-003]`); `NFR-001` by
itself is only a display label and is not a stable clause identity.

Not applicable: no non-functional target was stated in the pinned Story or clarification.

## Constitution articles

Cite the article IDs this specification is bound by `[SPK:REQ-100]`. The kernel validates that each
cited ID exists at the pinned revision before publication `[SPK:REQ-101]`.
None: this Story pinned no constitution.

## Assumptions

What this specification takes as true without proving. An assumption that turns out false is a
change request, not a defect — which is only true if it was written down.

The phrase “current calculator value” refers to the value currently held by the calculator when
the user invokes the hex operator. The Story and clarification do not specify the exact control
placement or the letter casing of hexadecimal digits.

## Out of scope

Named explicitly, so the boundary is reviewable rather than inferred.

Conversion of zero, negative, or fractional values; a specific control placement or keyboard
shortcut; and any non-functional targets not stated in the Story.

## Sources

Each supporting document this specification relies on, cited as `DOC-nnn — <name>`, and each one
offered to this phase that could not be read or was not available here, named as a gap. Without
supporting documents, say so.

- Pinned Story source: `singularity/work-items/hex-901/source.json`, description “Hex operator in
  calculator” and acceptance criterion “screenshot and testases”.
- Human clarification, specification generation 1: convert the current value; positive integers
  only; 16 displays as `10` with no prefix; test positive-number conversions and screenshot 16.
- No supporting documents were provided.
