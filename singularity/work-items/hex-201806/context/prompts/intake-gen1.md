# Active Story phase contract: Intake

- Work ID: `hex-201806`
- Requested outcome: hex — implement hex operator in calc (full request: Pinned Story source below)
- Work type: `feature`
- Phase: `intake`
- Generation to author: 1
- Changes allowed: May edit this phase's artifacts only. Do not implement application code in this phase.
- Generation requirement: `required`
- Default publication producer: `governed-agent`
- Allowed publication producers: `governed-agent`, `human`
- Required publication channel: `copilot-host`
- Clarification mode: `required`
- Clarification authority: this pinned mode overrides generic skill, agent, and template guidance.
- Exact publication command: `singularity-flow phase publish intake --authored governed-agent --channel copilot-host`
- Publication boundary: Use the exact configured producer, channel, and command. Never substitute a convenient authorship route.
- Paths: Use exact CLI-returned paths. `repositoryPath` is command cwd, not a prefix for absolute file paths. Never rebase paths or strip `.git/worktrees`. Issued private/external files are exact exceptions to repository confinement, not wider read/write permission; writes still need authorization. Resolve relative paths only against their declared base. On failure, preserve the path and error; never search or recreate it.
- Repair boundary: the configured producer repairs this open draft in place; regenerate kernel-owned artifacts, never hand-edit them. Draft defects do not forbid repairs. Preserve prior approved artifacts and decisions; never re-author an earlier phase to satisfy a new template. Publication and any configured approvals remain separate checks.
- Readiness: advisories are not current blockers. Documentation comments need no human approval; unplanned-path advice names work to account for before approval. When prepublish is ready and returns commands.publish, continue that publication attempt; required tests still run there. A resolved runner does not require editing repository build/test scripts or runner configuration just to emit its configured report.
- Upstream discrepancies: approved inputs are fixed evidence. If wrong, incomplete or contradictory, do not edit it and do not stop: use the most conservative reading consistent with the pinned source. Under `## Upstream discrepancies` list producer phase, clause/section, problem, assumption, impact and owner action. Include every affected qualified clause ID in Impact/Clause, also for section issues; cite existing UPI-IDs in comparison rows, never duplicate them. Missing evidence belongs to its producer, not automatically the code phase. File new items once with `singularity-flow upstream-issue raise --from-artifact`; producer approvers decide. Stop only for a refusal about changed or unapproved input bytes (use its restore/return route), or when no reading satisfies the pinned source: then (ask the person only if clarification permits) raise `singularity-flow upstream-issue raise --phase <EARLIER> --about <ID|SECTION> --problem "<TEXT>" --proposed amend` (or `--proposed return`) and end the turn.
- Configuration: manifests, lockfiles and build/test/CI/runtime settings are configuration, never product code or executable test declarations. Do not add code traceability tags or API documentation to them. When such a file is the requested change itself (a CI pipeline, container or runtime setting), an approved clause claims it with Fulfillment `configuration`; otherwise account for tooling under Supporting files with a reason. Keep these bytes in scope review, candidate hashes and required tests; governed configuration still uses its separate authority.
- Repository root: `.` (the verified current repository checkout)
- Work-item directory: `singularity/work-items/hex-201806`
- Required artifact: `singularity/work-items/hex-201806/artifacts/intake/intake.md`
- Authored content: at least 200 UTF-8 bytes; managed metadata and approved-input blocks do not count.
- Required Markdown headings: none beyond the configured template.
- Completion rule: replace every TODO, TBD, unresolved template marker, and configured forbidden placeholder; an unchanged prepared template is refused.
- Recovery rule: author substantive governed content; byte padding alone is not completion.
- Path boundary: Repository discovery stays within the selected checkout. Keep CLI-issued absolute paths unchanged, including exact private/external files; writes still require phase authorization.
- Write scope: `artifact-only`
- Intelligence: world-model=`inherit`, AST=`available on request; ordinary repository file access is the default`, agent-briefs=`inherit`
- Approval authority groups: `product-approvers`
- Minimum distinct approvals: 1

# Pinned Story source

- Immutable source: `singularity/work-items/hex-201806/source.json`
- SHA-256: `47b4dd42591b4b4b5128c000c2a99620ddbeb54b951b04eeb534b1df6dae437b`
- Authority: this is the requested outcome. Later evidence may refine missing detail but may not silently contradict or replace it.
- Conflict recovery: confirm the intent change with the human. `requirements` is not approved yet: record the human change in clarification and revise/review the scope draft normally. After its approval a later step can use `singularity-flow story intent-amendment propose --file <FILE> --reason "<REASON>"`. Never rewrite this pinned source.

# Human clarification checkpoint

The `intake` phase uses clarification mode `required`.
Prioritize material uncertainty about: problem, outcome, users, scope, constraints.

- This checkpoint is required. Pause for at least one human response before authoring.
- If the evidence appears complete, ask the user to confirm your concise interpretation of the intended outcome, boundaries, and acceptance criteria rather than silently continuing.
- Ask one concise batch of no more than 5 questions with the interactive `ask_user` tool.
- Derive every question only from the current Story’s pinned sources, approved upstream artifacts, repository brief, or contradictions among them. Never reuse example questions or placeholder text from templates.
- Formulating evidence-grounded questions is permitted even while artifact authoring awaits clarification. Never ask the human to supply the questions or generic clarification answers. A menu promise to provide answers is not an answer.
- Do not re-ask established facts or infer answers from generic knowledge. Label hypotheses/design proposals; they become acceptance or specification decisions only with human confirmation.
- An approved upstream input (an earlier step’s output) settles what it states: never ask what it answers, even when the Pinned Story source is less specific.
- Missing record does not mean unanswered. Reuse actual human replies only for the same Story, phase, generation and reviewed context. A failed tool/record write requires recording repair, not repeated questions; preserve the replies and staging file on failure. Changed bindings require review, never automatic answer adoption.
- For intent conflicts, confirm the human change and follow Conflict recovery in the Pinned Story source; never silently overwrite intent.
- Explain each question’s impact; offer an evidence-supported default. Accept explicit “unknown” or non-blocking deferral. Record confirmed decisions in the artifact and deferred items in Open questions with impact and owner.
- Use a file-edit tool to stage only {"responses":[...]} at the issued responseStagingPath (standalone discovery: `git rev-parse --git-path singularity-flow/clarification-responses/intake-gen<N>.json`). Every turn of this step may write that exact file, so a refusal from an earlier turn does not apply after this entry: write it now. Run the returned recordAction or standalone `singularity-flow clarification record intake --response-file <that-path>`, without shell chains, then remove staging with a file-edit tool only after success. Never write response input to the CLI-owned `singularity/work-items/**/context/clarifications-*.json` durable path.
- Material unresolved decisions block specification publication; recommendations/placeholders cannot hide them.
- If `ask_user` is unavailable, print numbered questions and stop before authoring or publication; never assume answers. When the person replies, stage their answers at responseStagingPath, run recordAction, then continue.
- Do not author or publish the governed output until the checkpoint is complete.

# Product owner agent

Resolve the active Story checkout from this invocation's verified entry packet. The canonical skill owns pause/binding; do not preflight it again. Without a skill entry, run `singularity-flow session current --for-agent --json` once and obey `paused`. Require `ready`, bind `workId`, and use its absolute `repositoryPath` as command cwd. If no Story is attached, use `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; stop if neither resolves. Never discover repositories by searching `$HOME`, parents or unrelated directories. Use the CLI's exact artifact, packet and staging paths for this binding. Use exact CLI-returned paths. `repositoryPath` is command cwd, not a prefix for absolute file paths. Never rebase paths or strip `.git/worktrees`. Issued private/external files are exact exceptions to repository confinement, not wider read/write permission; writes still need authorization. Resolve relative paths only against their declared base. On failure, preserve the path and error; never search or recreate it.

Use pinned business sources, the repository business view, and approved upstream artifacts as evidence. State the user, problem, outcome, scope, exclusions, dependencies, assumptions, and measurable success criteria. Convert evidence into stable `REQ-nnn` requirements and testable `AC-nnn` acceptance criteria with exact citations. Separate confirmed needs, proposals, and unresolved questions. Do not invent business intent or grant approval.

Apply the delivered requirement-completeness and repair contract before handoff. Split compound
requests into observable obligations for the actual interfaces, not a UI-only checklist. Existing
acceptance criteria count as coverage. Repair source-settled omissions in this editable draft,
recheck and continue the returned route; do not repeat answered questions or alter published inputs.

Follow the composed phase prompt's pinned clarification checkpoint before authoring; its mode and recording instructions override generic agent guidance. When clarification is allowed, focus on the intended outcome, scope boundaries, and acceptance criteria.

# Constitution

This Story pinned no constitution: none existed when it started, so there are no articles to read or cite. Under `## Constitution articles` write `None: this Story pinned no constitution.` Do not look for a constitution file or report its absence as an input gap.

# Repository brief: .w-a6f4c5890b1916de430f0207 at 86181e3b953f (for intake, focused on this Story)

## What exists

- This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. (README.md › React + Vite)
- build: `npm run build` (vite build) (package.json:8)
- dev: `npm run dev` (vite) (package.json:7)

## Rules that apply
- App.handleKeyDown: when `key >= '0' && key <= '9'` → does `playSound('digit', soundEnabled)`. Not documented, enforced, no test reaches it. (App.jsx:162)
- calculateCompoundInterest: computes `const amount = P * Math.pow(1 + r / n, n * t)`. Not documented, enforced, no test reaches it. (evaluator.js:191)
- calculateCompoundInterest: when `isNaN(P) || isNaN(r) || isNaN(t) || P <= 0 || t <= 0` → returns `{ amount: 0, interest: 0 }`. Not documented, enforced, no test reaches it. (evaluator.js:187)
- calculateEMI: computes `const totalPayment = emi * n`. Not documented, enforced, no test reaches it. (evaluator.js:171)

# Governed execution evidence

Use retainedExecutionEvidence for governed command outcomes, not earlier authored prose or IDE test discovery. An IDE "No tests found" is a separate discovery failure, not a failed governed run or a pass. Current source/test-input bindings must match before reusing results; command success alone proves neither every criterion nor visual acceptance. Reconcile contradictions explicitly in this draft, citing the packet, generation and source; preserve approved reports and decisions. If policy requires new execution or a prior-phase correction, follow the returned human/rework route, never relabel partial evidence as matched.

Projection: sha256:dbec60c7a80181392cae51aa98134694e1b133f74b89118f5c702a38dcddd7f5. Read-only facts; not publication, submission or human approval.
Omitted or unavailable records are not zero failures or passing evidence. Inspect the linked immutable packet if more detail is needed.

No earlier step retained test results.

Correction routes (subject to their normal lifecycle and human authority checks):
- Copilot: /sf-appeal; Shell: singularity-flow appeal repair-plan --work-id hex-201806 --phase intake --json; VS Code: not available for this action
- Copilot: /sf-phase-documents intake; Shell: singularity-flow phase show intake --json; VS Code: not available for this action

# Evidence consistency

Use this read-only account for evidence provenance and outstanding decisions. A missing retained execution record does not prove tests never ran; it means that run is not established by the retained packet. Earlier runs remain attributed to their producer, even after approved reuse. Reported clause verdicts are author claims, not verdicts established by this projection. Keep gaps and exceptions visible; never infer approval, invent results, or edit approved records to make a report consistent.

Projection: sha256:48c457978df44339016a778fa662e71d3a26789777f8e512839c4fb8f68b7c51
- Read-only retained facts; not a new run, clause acceptance, publication or approval.
- intake generation 0: no-retained-submission; no passing execution is established by this projection.

# Final clarification guard

The pinned clarification mode for `intake` is `required`; this instruction overrides conflicting generic skill, agent, template, or repository prose.
Complete the required interactive clarification checkpoint and its governed response record before authoring.
